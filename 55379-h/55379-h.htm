  <h2 class='c005'>RALEIGH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Very little is known concerning the youth of Sir Walter Raleigh.
He was a younger son, descended of an ancient family, and was born
at a farm called Hayes, near the mouth of the river Otter, in Devonshire,
in the year 1552. He went to Oriel College, Oxford, at an early
age, and gained high praise for the quickness and precocity of his
talents. In 1569 he began his military career in the civil wars of
France, as a volunteer in the Protestant cause. It is conjectured that
he remained in France for more than six years, and returned to England
in 1576. Soon after, he repaired to the Netherlands, and served
as a volunteer against the Spaniards. In such schools, and under such
leaders as Coligni and the Prince of Orange, Raleighâs natural aptitude
for political and military science received the best nurture: but
he was soon drawn from the war in Holland by a pursuit which had
captivated his imagination from an early ageâthe prosecution of discovery
in the New World. In conjunction with his half-brother, Sir
Humphrey Gilbert, a man of courage and ability, and a skilful sailor,
he made an unsuccessful attempt to establish a colony in North America.
Returning home in 1579, he immediately entered the Queenâs
army in Ireland, and served with good esteem for personal courage
and professional skill, until the suppression of the rebellion in that
country. He owed his introduction to court, and the personal favour
of Elizabeth, as is traditionally reported, to a fortunate and well-improved
accident, which is too familiar to need repetition here. It
is probable, however, that his name and talents were not unknown,
for we find him employed almost immediately in certain matters of
diplomacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the cares and pleasures of a courtierâs life, Raleigh preserved
his zeal for American discovery. He applied his own resources to
the fitting out of another expedition in 1583, under command of
Sir Humphrey Gilbert, which proved more unfortunate than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>former one: two out of five vessels returned home in consequence of
sickness, and two were wrecked, including that in which the admiral
sailed; and the only result of the enterprise was the taking possession
of Newfoundland in the name of England. Still Raleighâs desire for
American adventure was not damped. The Continent northward of
the Gulf of Florida was at this time unknown. But Raleigh, upon
careful study of the best authorities, had concluded that there was
good reason for believing that a considerable tract of land did exist in
that quarter; and with the assent of the Queen in council, from whom
he obtained letters patent, granting to himself and his heirs, under
certain reservations, property in such countries as he should discover,
with a right to provide for their protection and administration, he fitted
out two ships, which sailed in April, 1584. The first land which
they made was an island named Okakoke, running parallel to the
coast of North Carolina. They were well received by the natives,
and returned to England in the following autumn highly pleased.
Nor was less satisfaction felt by Raleigh, or even by the Queen, who
conferred on him the honour of knighthood, a title which was then in
high esteem, inasmuch as it was bestowed by that wise princess with
a most frugal and just discrimination. She also gave him a very
lucrative mark of favour, in the shape of a patent for licensing the
selling of wine throughout the kingdom; and she directed that the
new country, in allusion to herself, should be called Virginia. Raleigh
did not think it politic, perhaps was not allowed, to quit the
court to take charge in person of his undertaking; and those to whom
he intrusted the difficult task of directing the infant colony appear
to have been unequal to their office. It is not necessary to pursue the
history of an enterprise which proved unsuccessful, and in which Sir
Walter personally bore no share. He showed his earnestness by fitting
out several expeditions, which must have been a heavy drain upon his
fortune. But he is said to have derived immense wealth from prizes
captured from the Spaniards; and we may here observe that the lavish
magnificence in dress, especially in jewels, for which Raleigh was remarkable,
even in the gorgeous court of Elizabeth (his state dress is
said to have been enriched with jewels to the value of Â£60,000), may
be considered less as an extravagance, than as a safe and portable
investment of treasure. A mind less active might have found employment
more than enough in the variety of occupations which pressed
upon it at home. He possessed a large estate, granted out of forfeited
lands, in Ireland; but this was always a source rather of expense than
of profit, until, in 1601, he sold it to the Earl of Cork. He was
Seneschal of the Duchies of Cornwall and Exeter, and held the wardenship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>of the Stannaries; and in 1586, as well as formerly in 1584,
we find that he possessed a seat in parliament. In 1587, the formidable
preparation of the Spanish Armada withdrew the mind of Raleigh,
as of all Englishmen, from objects of minor importance, to the
defence of their country. He was a member of the council of war
directed to prepare a general scheme of defence, and held the office of
Lieutenant-General of Cornwall, in addition to the charge of the Isle
of Portland: but as on this occasion he possessed no naval command,
he was not actively engaged in the destruction of that mighty armament.
In 1589 he served as a volunteer in the expedition of Norris
and Drake to Portugal, of which some account has been given in the
life of the latter. Nor were his labours unrewarded even in that unfortunate
enterprise; for he captured several prizes, and received the
present of a gold chain from the Queen, in testimony of her approbation
of his conduct.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after these events, Raleigh retired to his Irish property, being
driven from court, according to some authorities, by the enmity of the
Earl of Essex, then a young man just rising into favour. He there
renewed a former intimacy with the poet Spenser, who, like himself,
had been rewarded with a grant of land out of forfeited estates, and
then resided at Kilcolman Castle. Spenser has celebrated the return of
his friend in the beautiful pastoral, âColin Cloutâs come home again;â
and in that, and various passages of his works, has made honourable
mention of the highly poetic spirit which enabled the âShepherd of
the Ocean,â as he is there denominated, to appreciate the merit of the
âFairy Queen,â and led him to promote the publication of it by every
means in his power. The loss of Raleighâs court-favour, if such there
were, could not have been of long duration on this occasion. But
he incurred more serious displeasure in consequence of a private
marriage contracted with Elizabeth Throgmorton, one of the Queenâs
maids of honour, a lady of beauty and accomplishments, who proved
her worth and fidelity in the long train of misfortunes which beset the
latter years of Raleighâs life. In consequence of this intrigue, he was
committed to the Tower. One or two amusing anecdotes are related
of the devices which he employed to obtain forgiveness, by working
on that vanity which was the Queenâs chief foible. He succeeded in
appeasing his indignant mistress so far as to procure his release; and
about the same time, in 1594, she granted to him the valuable manor
of Sherborne, in Dorsetshire: but though she requited his services,
she still forbade his appearance at court, where he now held the
office of Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard. Raleigh was peculiarly
fitted to adorn a court by his imposing person, the graceful magnificence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>of his taste and habits, the elegance of his manners, and the interest
of his conversation. These accomplishments were sure passports
to the favour of Elizabeth; and he improved to the utmost the
constant opportunities of intercourse with her which his post afforded,
insomuch that, except the Earls of Leicester and Essex, no one ever
seems to have stood higher in her graces. But Elizabethâs jealousy on
the subject of her favouritesâ marriages is well known, and her anger
was lasting, in proportion to the value which she set on the incense
of Raleighâs flattery. He retired, on his disgrace, to his new estate,
in the improvement and embellishment of which he felt great interest.
But though deeply alive to the beauties of nature, he had been too long
trained to a life of ambition and adventure to rest contented in the
tranquil routine of a country life; and during this period of seclusion,
he again turned his thoughts to his favourite subject of American
adventure, and laid the scheme of his first expedition to Guiana, in
search of the celebrated El Dorado, the fabled seat of inexhaustible
wealth. Having fitted out, with the assistance of other private persons,
a considerable fleet, Raleigh sailed from Plymouth, February 6, 1595.
He left his ships in the mouth of the river Orinoco, and sailed 400
miles into the interior in boats. It is to be recorded to his honour,
that he treated the Indians with great kindness; which, contrasted
with the savage conduct of the Spaniards, raised so friendly a feeling
towards him, that for years his return was eagerly expected, and at
length was hailed with delight. The hardships of the undertaking,
and the natural advantages of the country which he explored, are
eloquently described in his own account of the âDiscovery of Guiana.â
But the setting in of the rainy season rendered it necessary to return,
without having reached the promised land of wealth; and Raleigh
reaped no other fruit of his adventure than a certain quantity of
geographical knowledge, and a full conviction of the importance of
colonizing and taking possession of the newly-discovered region.
This continued through life to be his favourite scheme; but neither
Elizabeth nor her successor could be induced to view it in the same
favourable light.</p>

<p class='c000'>On reaching England, he found the Queen still unappeased; nor
was he suffered to appear at court: and he complains in pathetic
terms of the cold return with which his perils and losses were requited.
But he was invested with a high command in the expedition
of 1596, by which the Spanish fleet was destroyed in the harbour of
Cadiz; and to his judgment and temper in overruling the faulty
schemes proposed by others the success of that enterprise was chiefly
due. Indeed his services were perhaps too important, and too justly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>appreciated by the public, for his own interests: for the great and
general praise bestowed on him on this occasion tended to confirm
a jealousy of long standing on the part of the commander-in-chief,
the Earl of Essex; and it was probably owing to that favouriteâs
influence, that Raleigh was still forbidden the Queenâs presence.
Essex, and the Secretary of State, Sir Robert Cecil, regarded each
other with mutual distrust and dislike. Cecil and Raleigh were
connected by ties of common interest, and, as the latter supposed, of
friendship. Still Raleigh found the interest of the minister too weak
to serve his purpose, while the interest of the favourite was employed
against him; and, as the only method of effecting his own restoration
to the Queenâs favour, he undertook to work a reconciliation between
these two powerful rivals. In this he succeeded, to the great admiration
of all spectators; and the fruit of his policy was seen in his
re-admission to the execution of his official duties at court, June 1,
1597. In the following August he was appointed Rear Admiral in
the expedition called the Island Voyage, of which Essex held the
chief command. The slight successes which were obtained were again
due to the military talents of Raleigh; the main objects of the voyage
were lost through the Earlâs inexperience.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this time to the death of the Queen, Raleigh enjoyed an uninterrupted
course of favour. The ancient enmity between Essex and
himself was indeed renewed, and that with increased rancour; but the
indiscretions of the favourite had greatly weakened his influence.
Raleigh and Cecil spared no pains to undermine him, and were in
fact the chief workers of his ruin. This is perhaps the most unamiable
passage in Raleighâs life; and the only excuse to be pleaded
for him is, the determined enmity of that unfortunate nobleman.
This fault, however, brought a slow but severe punishment with it;
for the death of Essex dissolved the tie which held together Cecil and
himself. Neither could be content to act second to the other; and
Raleighâs high reputation, and versatile as well as profound abilities,
might well alarm the secretary for his own supremacy. The latter
took the surest way of establishing his power prospectively. Elizabeth
was now old: Cecil took no steps to diminish the high esteem in
which she held Sir Walter Raleigh, but he secretly laboured to prejudice
her successor against him, and he succeeded to his wish.
Very soon after the accession of James I., Raleighâs post of captain
of the guard was taken from him; and his patent of wines was
revoked, though not without a nominal compensation being made.
To complete his ruin, it was contrived to involve him in a charge of
treason. Most writers have concurred in speaking of this passage of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>history as inexplicable: it is the opinion of the last historian of
Raleigh, Mr. Tytler, that he has found sufficient evidence for regarding
the whole plot as a device of Cecil, and he has supported this
opinion by cogent arguments. Lord Cobham, a violent and ambitious
but weak man, had engaged in private dealings with the
Spanish ambassador, which brought him under the suspicion of the
government. By a device of Cecilâs (we here follow the account of
Mr. Tytler) he was induced, in a fit of anger, and in the belief that
Raleigh had given information against him, to accuse Sir Walter
himself of being privy to a conspiracy against the government. This
charge Cobham retracted, confirmed, and retracted again, behaving
in so equivocal a manner, that no reliance whatever can be placed
on any of his assertions. But as the King was afraid of Raleigh
as much as the secretary hated him, this vague charge, unsupported
by other evidence, was made sufficient to commit him to the
Tower; and, after being plied with private examinations, in which
nothing criminal could be elicited, he was brought to trial, November
17, 1603. For an account of that memorable scene we shall refer to
Mr. Jardineâs âCriminal Trials,â vol. i. It is reported to have been
said by one of the judges who presided over it, on his death-bed, that
âthe justice of England had never been so degraded and injured as
by the condemnation of Sir Walter Raleigh.â The behaviour of the
victim himself was the object of universal admiration, for the tempered
mixture of patience and noble spirit with which he bore the oppressive
measure dealt to him. He had before been unpopular; but it was
recorded by an eye-witness that âhe behaved himself so worthily, so
wisely, and so temperately, that in half a day the mind of all the company
was changed from the extremest hate to the extremest pity.â</p>

<p class='c000'>The sentence of death thus unfairly and disgracefully obtained was
not immediately carried into execution. James was not satisfied with
the evidence adduced on the trial; and believing at the same time
that Raleigh had been plotting against him, he set his royal wit to
dive into the mystery. Of the singular scene which our British Solomon
devised it is not necessary to speak, since Raleigh was not an
actor in it. But as no more evidence could be obtained against him
even by the Kingâs sagacity, he was reprieved, and remanded to the
Tower, where the next twelve years of his life were spent in confinement.
Fortunately, he had never ceased to cultivate literature with a
zeal not often found in the soldier and politician, and he now beguiled
the tedium of his lot by an entire devotion to those studies which
before had only served to diversify his more active and engrossing pursuits.
Of his poetical talents we have already made short mention:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>to the end of life he continued the practice of pouring out his mind in
verse, and there are several well-known and beautiful pieces expressive
of his feelings in prison, and in the anticipation of immediate death,
especially âThe Lie,â and the beautiful little poem called âThe Pilgrimage.â
He also possessed a strong turn for mathematics, and
studied them with much success in the society and under the guidance
of his friend Thomas Hariot, one of the most accomplished mathematicians
of the age. Chemistry was another favourite pursuit in which,
according to the standard of his contemporaries, he made great progress.
But the most important occupation of his imprisonment was
the composition of his âHistory of the World.â Notwithstanding
the quaintness of the style and the discursive manner in which the
subject is treated, it is impossible to read this volume without admiring
the wonderful extent of the authorâs reading, not only in history,
but in philosophy, theology, and even the ponderous and untempting
stores of Rabbinical learning. Many of the chapters relate to subjects
which few persons would expect to find in a history of the world; yet
these will often be found among the most interesting and characteristic
portions of the book; and its deep learning is relieved and set off by
passages of genuine eloquence, which display to the best advantage
the authorâs rich imagination and grasp of mind. The work extends
from the Creation to the end of the second Macedonian war. Raleigh
meant to bring it down to modern times; but the untimely death of
Henry Prince of Wales, for whose use it was composed, deprived him
of the spirit to proceed with so laborious an undertaking. He enjoyed
the confidence of that generous youth in a remarkable degree, and
maintained a close correspondence with him on civil, military, and
naval subjects. Several discourses on these topics, addressed to the
Prince, will be found in the editions of Raleighâs works. Henry
repaid these services with sincere friendship and admiration; and we
may presume that his adviser looked forward to that friendship, not
only for a cessation of misfortune, but for a more brilliant period of
favour and power than he had yet enjoyed. Fortunately, however,
this calamity was preceded by the death of his arch-enemy, Cecil; and
through the mediation of the Duke of Buckingham, employed in consideration
of 1500<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> paid to his uncles, Sir William, Sir John, and
Sir Edward Villiers, Raleigh was released from the Tower in March,
1615; and obtained permission to follow up his long-cherished scheme
of establishing a colony in Guiana and working a gold mine, of which
he had ascertained the existence and situation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The terms on which this licence was granted are remarkable. He
was not pardoned, but merely let loose on the engagement of his
friends, the Earls of Arundel and Pembroke, that he should return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>to England. Neither did James contribute to the expense of the
undertaking, though it was stipulated that he was to receive a fifth
part of the bullion imported. The necessary funds were provided out
of the wreck of Raleighâs fortune (his estate of Sherborne had been
forfeited) and by those private adventurers who were willing to risk
something in reliance on his experience and judgment. A fleet of
fourteen sail was thus provided, and Raleigh, by letters under the
privy seal, was appointed commander-in-chief and governor of the
intended colony. He relied, it is said, on the full powers granted
him by this commission as necessarily including a remission of all
past offences, and therefore neglected to sue out a formal pardon,
which at this period probably would hardly have been denied him.
The results of this disastrous voyage must be shortly given. Raleigh
sailed March 28, 1617, and reached the coast of Guiana in November
following. Being himself disabled by sickness from proceeding farther,
he dispatched a party to the mine under the command of Captain
Keymis, an officer who had served in the former voyage to Guiana.
But during the interval which had elapsed since Raleighâs first discovery
of that country, the Spaniards had extended their settlements
into it, and in particular had built a town called Santa Thome, in the
immediate neighbourhood of the mine in question. James, with his
usual duplicity, while he authorised the expedition, revealed every
particular connected with it to the Spanish ambassador. The English,
therefore, were expected in the Orinoco, and preparation had been
made for repelling them by force. Keymis and his men were unexpectedly
attacked by the garrison of Santa Thome, and a sharp contest
ensued, in which the English gained the advantage, and burnt the
town. In this action Raleighâs eldest son was killed. The Spaniards
still occupied the passes to the mine, and after an unsuccessful attempt
to dislodge them, Keymis abandoned the enterprize, and returned to
the ships. Raleighâs correspondence expresses in affecting terms his
grief and indignation at this double misfortune; the loss of a brave
and promising son, and the destruction of the hopes which he had
founded on this long-cherished adventure. On his return to England,
he found himself marked out for a victim to appease the resentment
of the Spanish court, to which he had long been an object of fear and
hatred. He quietly surrendered himself to Sir Lewis Stukeley, who
was sent to Plymouth to arrest him, and commenced the journey
to London under his charge. But his mind fluctuated between the
desire to confront his enemies, and a sense of the hopelessness of obtaining
justice, and he was at last entrapped by the artifices of the
emissaries of government who surrounded him into an attempt to
escape, in which he was arrested and committed to close custody in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the Tower. Here his conversation and correspondence were narrowly
watched, in the hopes that a treasonable understanding with the
French government, from which he had received the offer of an
asylum in France, might be established against him. His conduct
abroad had already been closely scrutinized, in the hope of finding
some act of piracy, or unauthorized aggression against Spain, for
which he might be brought to trial. Both these hopes failing, and
his death, in compliment to Spain, being resolved on, it was determined
to carry into effect the sentence passed fifteen years before,
from which he had never been legally released; and a warrant was
accordingly issued to the judges, requiring them to order execution.
The case was a novel one, and threw that learned body into some perplexity.
They determined, however, that after so long an interval
execution could not be granted without allowing the prisoner the
opportunity of pleading against it; and Raleigh was therefore brought
to the bar of the Court of Kingâs Bench, October 28, 1618. The
record of his conviction having been read, he was asked whether he
could urge any thing why the sentence should not be carried into
effect. He insisted on the nature of his late commission, and on that
plea being overruled, submitted with his usual calmness and dignity.
The execution, with indecent haste, was ordered to take place on the
following morning. In this last stage of life, his greatness of mind
shone with even more than its usual lustre. Calm, and fearless without
bravado, his behaviour and speech expressed the piety and resignation
of a Christian with the habitual coolness of one who has braved
death too often to shrink at its approach. The accounts of his deportment
on the scaffold effectually refute the charges of irreligion and
atheism which some writers have brought against him, unless we make
up our minds to believe him an accomplished hypocrite. He spoke
at considerable length, and his dying words have been faithfully reported.
They contain a denial of all the serious offences laid to his
charge, and express his forgiveness of those even who had betrayed him
under the mask of friendship. After delivering this address and spending
some time in prayer, he laid his head on the block, and breathing
a short private prayer, gave the signal to the executioner. Not being
immediately obeyed, he partially raised his head, and said, âWhat
dost thou fear? Strike, man!â and underwent the fatal blow without
shrinking or alteration of position. He died in his sixty-sixth year.</p>

<p class='c000'>Raleigh sat in several parliaments, and took an active part in the
business of the house. His speeches, preserved in the Journals, are
said by Mr. Tytler to be remarkable for an originality and freedom of
thought far in advance of the time. His expression was varied and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>animated, and his powers of conversation remarkable. His person
was dignified and handsome, and he excelled in bodily accomplishments
and martial exercises. He was very fond of paintings, and of
music; and, in literature as in art, he possessed a cultivated and correct
taste. He was one of those rare men who seem qualified to excel
in all pursuits alike; and his talents were set off by an extraordinary
laboriousness, and capacity of application. As a navigator, soldier,
statesman, and historian, his name is intimately and honourably linked
with one of the most brilliant periods of British history.</p>

<p class='c000'>The works of Oldys, Birch, Cayley, Mrs. Thompson, and Mr.
Tytler, may be consulted concerning this remarkable person. The
life of the last-named gentleman, published in the âEdinburgh Cabinet
Library,â is the most recent; and the industry of the author has
enabled him to gain a clue to some points which before had been
imperfectly understood. A list of Raleighâs numerous works is given
in the âBiographia Britannica.â They will be found collected in eight
volumes, in the Oxford edition of 1829. Several of his MSS. are
preserved in the British Museum.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>JENNER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Edward, the third son of the Rev. Stephen Jenner, was born May
17, 1749, in the vicarage-house of Berkeley in Gloucestershire, of
which parish his father, a man of independent fortune, and of a
family long established and esteemed in that neighbourhood, was
incumbent. At the death of that parent in 1754, the care of Edward
Jennerâs education devolved upon his eldest brother, Stephen, who
succeeded to the living of Berkeley, and faithfully and affectionately
discharged the duties of a father towards him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He began at a very early age to give tokens of that fondness and
aptitude for the study of natural history, which first directed the choice
of his profession; and afterwards led him, by steps which may be
easily traced, to the discovery of a method of securing the constitution
against the small-pox, by a remedy so mild as to be scarcely an inconvenience,
yet so effectual as almost to have extinguished that disease
in some countries where it has been energetically used.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having finished his school education and fixed upon a profession,
Jenner was apprenticed at the usual age to Mr. Ludlow, a surgeon
practising at Sodbury near Bristol; and in 1770, when nearly twenty-one,
he came to London, and put himself under the tuition of John
Hunter, in whose house he lived for two years, as much in the capacity
of a friend as in that of a pupil, with great advantage to his professional
studies. The intimacy between these two eminent men was
very close and cordial, and subsisted till Hunterâs sudden death in
1793. It is attested by many letters from Mr. Hunter, which Jenner
carefully preserved; his own were probably destroyed with the rest of
Hunterâs papers by the late Sir Everard Home. Their correspondence
relates chiefly to facts and experiments in natural history.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The success with which Jenner had already pursued his studies,
and the respect entertained for his talents by his illustrious instructor
at a period when their intercourse was yet in its infancy, may be
gathered from his being selected in 1771, on the recommendation of
Mr. Hunter, to arrange the collections in natural history which had
been made by Sir Joseph Banks in his voyage round the world with
Captain Cook, then just completed. Jenner acquitted himself so well
of this charge, that he was offered, though little more than twenty-two
years of age, the situation of naturalist to the second expedition under
the command of Captain Cook, which sailed in 1772. This was a
flattering proposal to so young a man, and consonant to Jennerâs
ruling tastes; nevertheless he declined it. It is fortunate for mankind
that he chose the laborious seclusion of a country practice in
preference to aiming at distinction and wealth; for in no other sphere
could he have found opportunities of pursuing his discovery of vaccination
through all the perplexities in which his early researches into
that subject involved him. Indeed, it is probable that considerations
of this kind, independently of his fondness for a country life, had
their weight with him in the choice; for the idea had already taken
strong hold of his naturally sanguine feelings and quick apprehension,
that he was furnished with a clue which might lead him to a result of
the highest importance to mankind.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be added here that a few years after this time he declined a
very lucrative situation in India, as well as a much more tempting
proposal from Mr. Hunter, in 1775, to join him in a project for establishing
in London a school of natural history, including medicine, of
which Jenner was to undertake the anatomical department.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having determined to settle in the country, and being amply provided
with the requisite knowledge, Jenner established himself as a
general practitioner at Berkeley. Here he speedily acquired a profitable
and extensive practice; so much so, indeed, that finding his
health giving way, he was obliged to limit himself to the practice of
medicine alone; for which purpose he purchased, as it was then customary,
the degree of doctor at St. Andrewâs in 1792.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he not only attained at an early age to a high degree of professional
reputation, but won the affectionate esteem of all with whom
he associated. It is related of him that his friends were in the habit of
joining in his daily professional rides, often of considerable extent,
for the sake of his agreeable and instructive conversation; and that
when any of them were ill, he would sometimes make their houses the
head-quarters of his practice for the time being, and remain in close
attendance upon them till their recovery.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Music, the lighter kinds of literature, both as a reader and occasionally
as an author, and the innocent recreations of society, which no one
enjoyed more keenly than himself, were the means by which Jenner
lightened the burden of his professional labours; but his chief amusement
was natural history, including geology, a science then in its infancy,
for the study of which his position in the vale of Gloucester
afforded ample opportunity, the neighbourhood abounding with fossil
remains, and exhibiting a great variety of terrestrial structure. Towards
subjects of this nature he was led, not only by his original bias,
but by his correspondence with Hunter, Banks, and Parry.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1778 he formed a medical society, which held its periodical
meetings at Rodborough, for the purpose of communicating professional
information and promoting a friendly feeling among the members.
In furtherance of these objects, Jenner contributed several
important and original papers, the substance of which is now embodied
in medical science, without his property in them being generally
known. Among these were essays on the nature and causes of
Angina Pectoris, on a peculiar disease of the heart occurring in acute
rheumatism, and on several of the more severe affections of the eye.
He also belonged to another medical society, meeting at Alveston
near Bristol, to the members of which, who were men of congenial
dispositions with his own, he was personally much attached. Upon
one topic, however, they did not agree; for it is said that he was in
the habit of enlarging so frequently upon his favourite speculation of
the cow-pox, that the subject was at length proscribed, and he was
jestingly forbidden to renew it on pain of expulsion. This club was
for many years a source of much enjoyment and advantage to him, and
we may suppose that he was a very principal contributor to the diversion
of the other members; for it ceased to exist in 1789, when other
objects began to engross the time that he could spare from his practice.
In March of the previous year, at the age of thirty-seven, he
married Miss Catharine Kingscote, by whom he had several children.
The choice appears to have been a very fortunate one for his domestic
happiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1786 he had communicated to Mr. Hunter, in the form of an
essay, the result of several yearsâ careful observation of the singular
habits of the cuckoo, till then a mystery to naturalists. It was presented
by Mr. Hunter to the Royal Society, and was printed entire in
their Transactions in 1789, having been returned to Jenner in the
mean time, in order that he might record some additional facts which
he had ascertained. This tract has been considered as a very masterly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>performance, and was the occasion of the author being elected to the
fellowship of the Royal Society. It is not a little remarkable that
Mr. Hunter, like Jennerâs friends at Alveston, thought so doubtfully
of his views on the subject of vaccination, that he cautioned him against
publishing them, lest they should interfere with the fame he had acquired
in the learned world by his âEssay on the Cuckoo.â But the
event proved that the caution, though well meant, was unnecessary.
Jenner was not more disposed than his gifted master to admit any
conclusion on merely collateral grounds, that might be put to the test
of experiment. This, however, was too new and important a matter
to be lightly or prematurely hazarded; and Jenner waited long and
patiently for an opportunity of thus testing his opinions, losing in the
mean time no occasion of collecting additional information. The idea,
thus watchfully and laboriously improved, was first excited in his
mind while he was an apprentice at Sodbury, by a remark accidentally
dropped by a young countrywoman in his masterâs surgery, who,
overhearing a conversation about the small-pox, observed that she had
no fear of catching that disease as she had taken the <em>cow-pox</em>. Jenner,
who was always alive to any subject connected with natural history,
was induced to make more particular inquiries into this complaint,
of which he had never heard before; and the answers he received
were such as to suggest the probability of substituting it with advantage
for the inoculated small-pox. Of this theory he never lost sight
till he established it on the clearest evidence, and with it his unrivalled
claim to the perpetual gratitude of mankind.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cow-pox is a disease of the eruptive kind, which is sometimes
extensively prevalent among cattle in large dairy countries where they
are herded together in numbers, but often disappears for a long time
together. Though commonly mild, it is occasionally so severe as to
terminate fatally; and it is believed, on strong grounds, to have been at
different times even pestilential among them, and as such, to have been
mentioned by various writers on rural economy, ancient and modern,
as well as in medical and other histories. It is generally, however, a very
mild disorder, appearing on the udder of the cow, at first in the form
of vesicles much resembling those of small-pox; and it is sometimes,
as in the instance which first attracted the attention of Jenner, communicated
to the hands of milkers. In such cases, an eruption of
similar vesicles takes place on the hands and arms, not without much
swelling and inflammation, and occasionally with fever and disturbance
of the health for some days. It has never been known to prove fatal
when thus communicated, or to have left any unpleasant effects behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>it, except a few indented marks in the situation occupied by the pustules.
It is not communicable, like small-pox in the human subject,
by the effluvia; but the matter, or lymph as it is called, contained in
the vesicles, must be actually inserted under the skin, or applied to a
raw or an absorbing surface. But the most important of its peculiarities
is the security it affords against the infection of small-pox.
This property was well known among the agricultural classes in the
grazing districts before the time of Jenner, and it has been stated that
individuals among them had turned their knowledge of it to account
for the protection of their families, by inoculating them with the vaccine
disease. But this circumstance, alleged on very scanty evidence
by those who were opposed to Jennerâs claims, cannot lessen the merit
of his independent discovery, of which each step was communicated in
succession to a numerous circle of medical friends, and is recorded in
the most authentic form. His reputation is, on the other hand, enhanced
by the fact that, although the immunity conferred by the casual
disease in milkers had frequently come under the notice of medical
men from their failing in such persons to produce the small-pox by
inoculation, yet the idea of introducing the disease of an animal into
the human frame was so little in consonance with any former practice,
that Jenner was the first among his brethren to conjecture that cow-pox,
as the milder disease, might advantageously supersede the inoculated
small-pox; and that, as the latter is rendered less virulent by
inoculation, so the former introduced in the same way might be milder
than the casual complaint, and yet retain its protecting power. He
had even communicated this conjecture to Hunter, himself no mean
innovator in medicine, so early as the year 1770; and Mr. Hunter
was for many years in the habit of mentioning it in his public lectures
coupled with Jennerâs name: but the proposed substitution was so
distasteful, or appeared of such questionable propriety, that it obtained
no favourable notice till it was forced by the inventor on the public
attention, thirty years after it had first attracted his own.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be interesting to enter into a detail of the progress of
Jennerâs discovery and of its introduction into general use, as well as
to show its inestimable value to society by a reference to statistical
facts. This, however, can only be done here in a very cursory manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The way in which the idea was first suggested to him has been
already mentioned. After his return to Berkeley from London, he
pursued the subject with great patience and sagacity for many years.
In the course of these preliminary inquiries he found reason to believe
that of several kinds of vesicular disease in the cow, but one had the
property of securing from the small-pox, and that one exclusively, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>at least with the greatest certainty, in its first stage. He also ascertained
that the horse is subject to an eruption of similar vesicles, apparently
arising without infection, and popularly known by the name of
the <em>grease</em>. The matter issuing from these is sometimes conveyed to
the cow by milkers engaged in farriery; and Jenner conceived it to
be the original and only source of cow-pox among the herds. The
opinion is not generally held at present to its full extent; but experiments
by himself and others since the publication of his Inquiry have
proved a fact much disputed at the time, that he was right in believing
the diseases to be identical, whatever may be their origin.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be mentioned as a curious circumstance, that the first lymph
transmitted in an active state to British India in 1802 by Dr. De
Carro of Vienna, long the only source of vaccination in that country,
had been furnished to him by Dr. Sacco of Milan, from genuine vesicles
produced by direct inoculation from the horse, without passing
through the cow; an intervention which, till about that period, Jenner
had continued to think essential to the production of the true disease
in man.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to these and other curious results, laboriously collected
during a period of twenty-six years, Dr. Jenner at length arrived at a
rational conviction of the safety of the experiment he meditated, from
observing the invariable harmlessness of the disease when casually
taken: he determined therefore to put his long-cherished idea to the
trial on the first opportunity.</p>

<p class='c000'>This offered on the 14th of May, 1796, the anniversary of which is
still kept as a festival at Berlin. On that day he inoculated a boy of
the name of Phipps in the arm, from a pustule on the hand of a young
woman who was infected by her masterâs cows. The boy went favourably
through the disease. On the 1st of July he was inoculated for
the small-pox, and, as Jenner had predicted, without effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>The feelings of the sanguine philanthropist may be conceived.
They cannot be better described than they have been by himself in
the following terms. âWhile the vaccine discovery was progressive,
the joy I felt at the prospect before me of being the instrument destined
to take away from the world one of its greatest calamities,
blended with the fond hope of enjoying independence and domestic
peace and happiness, was often so excessive, that in pursuing my
favourite subject among the meadows, I have sometimes found myself
in a reverie. It is pleasant to me to recollect that these reflections
always ended in devout acknowledgments to that Being from whom
this and all other mercies flow.â</p>

<p class='c000'>During the next two years many other equally successful trials were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>made; and at length the discovery was published to the world in June,
1798, in a quarto pamphlet of seventy pages, which had been previously
subjected to the most rigorous criticism and revision by a few
chosen friends who met for that purpose at the house of Thomas Westfaling,
Esq., at Rudhall, near Ross. It is entitled âAn Inquiry into
the Causes and Effects of the VariolÃ¦ VaccinÃ¦; a disease discovered
in some of the Western Counties of England, particularly Gloucestershire,
and known by the name of the Cow-pox.â The pamphlet is
enriched with the detail of sixteen cases of the casual, and seven of the
inoculated disease, the latter including the case of one of the authorâs
sons; and with coloured drawings of the appearances in both.</p>

<p class='c000'>The style of this pamphlet, as well as of others which succeeded it
from Jennerâs pen in the course of a few years, is remarkably modest,
and admirable in all respects, which probably contributed much to the
early favour it received. The facts were such as to defy contradiction,
and the conclusions so just and mature, that the experience of nearly
forty years has been able to add little more than its seal of confirmation
to them. The few errors that have been detected relate chiefly to the
degree of protection afforded by the cow-pox, which Jenner affirmed
to be perfect: it is now however believed to be incomplete, perhaps in
three instances out of every hundred; that small proportionate number
passing, in general after the lapse of some years, through a very mild
and modified small-pox, in which the per-centage of fatal cases is certainly
not more, and probably much less, than five; being not more than
three in 2000 of all vaccinated persons, while the rate of mortality
even in inoculated small-pox is one in fifty, or forty in 2000. It
should be borne in mind that small-pox itself sometimes occurs a
second time even in a severe and fatal form, as in the case of Louis
XV. Some constitutional peculiarity is probably the occasion of both
these anomalies; and this supposition will also account for the often-observed
fact, that small-pox after vaccination commonly affects several
members of the same family almost simultaneously, thus giving an
appearance of failure in a proportion much greater than the truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another position advanced by Jenner in this pamphlet is too remarkable
to be passed over. After stating his belief that the cow-pox
originates from the horse in the way already mentioned, he proceeds
to suggest that the small-pox may have been itself originally morbid
matter of the same kind, aggravated into a malignant and contagious
form by accidental circumstances. But this opinion, though plausible,
is not considered by any means as established.</p>

<p class='c000'>Favourably as his work was received, the author, who had come to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>London partly to superintend the publication, was unable to obtain an
opportunity of displaying the disease in that city, which had been the
chief object of his visit; and returned, much disappointed, to Cheltenham,
where he now frequently resided, in the middle of July. He
left, however, some vaccine lymph with Mr. Cline, who was the first
surgeon in London that ventured to make a trial of it. The complete
success of the experiment, which was publicly performed, so strongly
interested the profession, that the new practice became quickly popular,
in spite of a warm though partial opposition, which was put down
in the summer of 1799 by a manifesto expressive of confidence in its
efficacy and safety, signed by seventy-three of the most eminent medical
men in the metropolis. In the same year some unfortunate occurrences
took place in consequence of Dr. Woodville, the physician of
the Small-pox Hospital, having incautiously used and distributed
matter from persons whom he had inoculated with small-pox a few
days after vaccination, before it had taken a sufficient hold. The
mongrel lymph thus produced sometimes occasioned one, sometimes
the other disease; their effects were confounded; and some deaths
which ensued, as well as a general eruption of the skin which took
place in many instances, were attributed to the cow-pox. This and
other mistakes would probably have much retarded the general adoption
of vaccination, but for the promptitude of Jenner to discover and
expose the source of the error.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1802 a parliamentary inquiry into the value of the new method
of preventing small-pox, including Jennerâs claim to the discovery of
it, was instituted, and a grant was voted to him of 10,000<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> In 1807
he received an additional vote of 20,000<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i>, which, considering that he
had been the instrument of saving in England alone at least 45,000
lives annually, will seem by no means an extravagant mark of national
gratitude and respect.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1803 the Royal Jennerian Society, for the encouragement of
vaccination, was established in London under the superintendence of
Dr. Jenner. In 1808 this society was merged by his advice in the
National Vaccine Establishment, which still continues to dispense
the blessings of the antidote at the public charge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The growing interest in the public mind in favour of vaccination
was of course everywhere extended to its author, who, in spite of
several unworthy cabals, and attempts to deprive him of the credit of
a discovery peculiarly his own, was received among all ranks with
the highest distinction at home, and also gratified with various continental
honours. If he had thought fit to settle in London, he might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>undoubtedly have secured wealth in proportion to his reputation; but
he preferred the quiet enjoyment of rural life and domestic happiness.
His death took place at Berkeley, from a sudden attack of apoplexy, in
February, 1823, in the seventy-fourth year of his age. The latter
years of his life were spent between Berkeley and Cheltenham, and
in occasional visits to London, in the zealous prosecution of his
favourite subjects of research, and successful endeavours to diffuse the
blessings of his discovery more widely in his own and other lands.</p>

<p class='c000'>In England, however, these have not been so extensively felt as
in some other countries where the form of government has given
facilities for the enforcement of vaccination. The small-pox consequently
prevails to a considerable extent in this country, and especially
in London. Yet the annual number of deaths from small-pox within
the bills of mortality is at present under 700; the largest number in
one year since the general practice of vaccination having been 1299, in
1825. A century ago, when the population certainly did not reach
half its present amount, the yearly average was 2000, the maximum
being in 1796, when the mortality swelled to 3549. That this decrease
is wholly due to vaccination cannot be doubted; the advantage,
however, is partly indirect, and has arisen from the discontinuance of
the practice of inoculating for the small-pox, which afforded security
to individuals, but increased the general mortality by keeping alive a
constant source of infection. But the most striking examples of the
advantage derived from vaccination are to be found on the continent.
Thus at Berlin, where the average annual amount of deaths from
small-pox was 472 for the twenty years previous to 1802, and 1646
died in 1801, the mortality so speedily diminished after the enforcement
of vaccination by law, that in 1821 and 1822 there was only one
death in each year. These and similar instances which might be adduced
from other countries, seem almost to warrant us in adopting the
sanguine expectation of Jenner, that by means of his discovery this
disgusting and dreadful malady, from which not four in a hundred of
the human race wholly escaped, and which destroyed a tenth part of
all that were born, and disfigured where it did not destroy, may yet be
swept from the face of the earth.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>MASKELYNE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Nevil Maskelyne was born in London, October 6, 1732. He was
educated at Westminster, and in time proceeded to Catherine Hall,
Cambridge, from whence he migrated to Trinity College. He took
the degree of Bachelor of Arts, with honours, in the year 1754. In
1755, he was ordained to a curacy near London. He had previously
turned his attention to astronomy, to which he was led by the solar
eclipse of 1748; and he now formed an acquaintance with Bradley,
an astronomer of unequalled merit, whether in discovery or practical
excellence in observation, whom he assisted in calculating his table
of refractions. It is no wonder that, under such instruction, Maskelyne
should have distinguished himself afterwards as an observer.
From this period (<span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A.D.</span></span> 1750) Delambre dates the commencement
of really good observations.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1758 Maskelyne was elected Fellow of his college; in 1759 he
became Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1761 he went to St. Helena,
to observe the transit of Venus, and also to collect such observations
as might, if possible, enable him to detect the parallax of the fixed
stars. He failed in both objects; in the first from cloudy weather, in
the second from faulty instruments, as he supposed, though the quantity
in question is so small that its existence has not yet been detected;
but he was enabled to correct the principal errors of those instruments
in a considerable degree, and also to make very good observations on
various other points. In his voyage out and home he applied himself
to perfect the method of observing lunar distances, and deducing the
longitude from them. In 1764 he sailed to Barbadoes, to make a trial
of Harrisonâs time-keeper; and in 1765 he was appointed Astronomer
Royal, on the decease of Mr. Bliss. He was then only thirty-three
years of age, and had enjoyed a rapid career of celebrity. He had
published enough in the âBritish Marinerâs Guide,â <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A.D.</span></span> 1763, to
require honourable mention of his name and methods in every work of
navigation.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>As soon as he had obtained the post of Astronomer Royal, he began
to call the attention of the Commissioners of Longitude to the practicability
of the method of lunar distances, and proposed to them to
establish a Nautical Almanac, which should contain such an ephemeris
of the moonâs path as would make the object in view attainable. The
memorial on this subject was presented February 9, 1765, and the
evidence of various officers of the East India Companyâs service was
taken as to the success of the method. The lunar tables of Mayer
furnished the proposed materials for the moonâs places; and upon the
adoption of the scheme of Maskelyne, a parliamentary reward of 3000<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i>
was given to Mayerâs widow. To Maskelyne we are thus indebted
for a work which has more than any other contributed to the advancement
of navigation, in the removal of the great difficulty of finding the
longitude. It is true that this first effort could hardly then be expected
to give the longitude within a degree; but this was a great improvement,
when it is considered that the reckoning of a ship might
be out several degrees, and that chronometers had not yet been introduced.
But the âNautical Almanacâ must be considered as a work
addressed to astronomers as well as seamen, from its earliest commencement.
Maskelyne saw the importance of saving the observer
the trouble and risk of error which would attend his reductions without
such assistance, and contemplated the continual improvement of
the lunar tables. It is not one of the least obligations which astronomical
science owes to Maskelyne, that since his time a very slender
portion of mathematical knowledge will enable a diligent observer to
turn his means to good account in the promotion of sidereal and even
of planetary astronomy. Without saying that the observer, as such,
is employed about the highest department of the science, or in any
way recommending the lover of observation to stop his career at that
point, we may remind him that, with the assistance of an ephemeris,
such as the âNautical Almanacâ of Maskelyne did, still more as that
of the present day, he can never want the means of turning his amusements
to useful purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first Nautical Almanac was published in 1767, and was continued
by Maskelyne to the end of his life. The requisite tables,
intended to accompany that work, were first published by him in
1781.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>With the exception of attending the meetings of the Royal Society,
Maskelyne hardly ever quitted his observatory. His life is therefore
difficult to describe, except by its results. But in 1772 he went to
Scotland, to pursue his celebrated experiment for the discovery of the
earthâs density. The Newtonian doctrine of attraction, in the general
form, that all matter attracts all other matter, could hardly be said to
be finally established, except as a point of strong probability. That
a planet, considered as a whole, attracts a planet, might be thought
to be demonstrated, but there was no proof of matter being the agent
of attraction upon matter, <em>on the earth</em>, except in the case of magnetised
or electrified bodies. The notion that the attraction of a mountain, if
it existed, would cause a slight deviation of the plumb-line, which
should be perceptible in its effect on the observed position of the stars,
had been entertained, and the effect even suspected, but without being
reduced to absolute proof. To give an idea of the minuteness of the
angle of deviation which was to be looked for, we may state that a
pendulum ten thousand inches long, vibrating through an angle of ten
seconds, would only move through half an inch at the end farthest
from the point of suspension, and that ten seconds was, as it turned
out, nearly double of the angle in question. Maskelyne chose the
mountain Schehallien, in Perthshire, as the scene of his operations.
By observing well-known stars with an instrument depending on a
plumb-line, both north and south of the mountain, he determined the
difference of latitude of two stations, subject of course to an error if
the plumb-line were affected in its position by the attraction of the
mountain. He then measured the difference of latitude of his stations
by a trigonometrical survey, which gave their relative position by a
method independent of the plumb-line and its errors. He thus found
that his north and south plumb-lines were inclined to each other at
an angle of about eleven seconds and a half more than they should
have been from their difference of position on the earth, and that the
direction of their inclination was towards the mountain. He deduced
his results from those among his observations which he considered as
the best, being about one out of ten of the whole; but it is much to
his credit as an observer, that Baron Zach afterwards found that all
his observations, good and bad, gave the same average result as those
he had selected. Zach also established the same fact by his observations
in the neighbourhood of Marseilles, namely, that the vicinity of a
mountain affects the level, which was the instrument he used, and not
the plumb-line.</p>

<p class='c000'>The labour of deducing an approximation to the earthâs mean density
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>was undertaken by Dr. Hutton. By getting the best possible estimate
of the materials of which Schehallien is composed, and comparing
what we must call the weight of the plumb-line <em>towards the mountain</em>
with its weight towards the earth, it appeared that the mean density
of the latter is about five times that of water. This, considered as a
numerical approximation, alone and unsupported, would have been
worth little, owing to the doubt which must have existed as to the
correctness of the estimation of the mountainâs density. It would
prove that there was attraction in the mountain, but would give no
very great probability to the value of the earthâs density, as deduced.
But a few years afterwards Cavendish made an experiment, with the
same object, and by an entirely different method. By producing oscillations
in leaden balls by means of other leaden balls, and by a process
of reasoning wholly free from astronomical data, he inferred that the
mean density of the earth was five and a-half times that of water.
The experiment of Cavendish was published in 1798. It is much to be
wished that the experiments of Cavendish should be repeated on a
larger scale: but the expense of the apparatus will probably deter individuals
from the attempt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Schehallien experiment was carried on under many difficulties
and privations; and its successful result places its author in the list
of those who first opened the road to the determination of a fundamental
element of the solar system. But brilliant as it must appear,
it is by no means the most useful of Maskelyneâs labours. Excepting
Bradley, he may almost be called the first who systematically directed
his efforts to the attainment of the minutest accuracy in astronomical
observation. His celebrated catalogue, <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A.D.</span></span> 1790, consisted only of
thirty-six of the principal stars, but the places of these, especially in
right ascension, were determined with a degree of precision which was
then believed to be hardly attainable. The means by which he accomplished
his objects, such as taking the nearest tenth of a second
instead of the nearest second, or half second, of time in his transit
observations, the practice of uniformly observing all the wires of the
instrument, instead of one; the introduction of the movable eye-piece,
by which the several wires could all be viewed directly, instead of
obliquely, and many little things of the kind, are the indications of a
man who was familiar above his contemporaries with the sources of
error, and who had formed at once a bold estimate of the extent to
which they might be avoided, and a correct view of the means of doing
it. It is difficult to say what portion of the present improved spirit of
observation in these points may be attributed to Maskelyne, but it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>certainly was not small. Delambre, who knew at least as well as any
man of his time what had been done and was doing, and who was
never profuse of praise, as his âHistory of Astronomyâ amply demonstrates,
pays him the following compliment in the memoir which he
contributed to the â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Biographie Universelle</span>:âââ<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maskelyne Ã©tait en
correspondance avec tous les astronomes de lâEurope, quâil considÃ©rait
comme ses frÃ¨res, et qui, de leur cÃ´tÃ©, le respectaient comme un
doyen, dont les travaux leur avaient Ã©tÃ© Ã©minemment utiles.</span>â</p>

<p class='c000'>We have spoken, in the life of Harrison, of the controversy about the
merits of the time-piece of the latter. As Astronomer Royal, Maskelyne
was the official investigator of the rates of those instruments,
and both in the case of Harrison, and in that of Mudge, his decisions
underwent printed attacks, which he answered. Without entering
into the merits of these questions, since all the grave accusations
which were brought against him have fallen harmless, we shall only
state, that Maskelyneâs answers are full of documents, and free from
passion; both very favourable symptoms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Maskelyne held church preferment from his college, and was
besides in possession of an easy fortune. He died Feb. 9, 1811,
leaving behind him an unblemished personal reputation, and a character
for scientific utility of the first order. He left behind him much
evidence of his utility in the labours and character of the assistants
whom he formed; all of whom, says Lalande, were useful astronomers.
The late Dr. Brinkley, Bishop of Cloyne, who added the reputation of
a distinguished mathematician to that of an eminent observer, was for
sometime one of his pupils in the practical part of the science.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Thomas Hobbes was eighty-four years of age he composed an
amusing account of his own fortunes in Latin hexameter and pentameter
verses; and in these it is mentioned that his birth was premature,
owing to the terror occasioned to his mother by a false report
of the approach of the Spanish fleet. To this accident he humorously
ascribes his patriotic zeal and the peacefulness of his disposition.
We quote from a translation made by a contemporary hand, which in
elegance of expression is on a par with the original.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It was at Malmsbury, on the 5th of April, 1588, that this very
singular man was thus called into an existence, which was continued,
in perpetual activity, for ninety-one years.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the earliest efforts of his talents was to translate the Medea
of Euripides into Latin iambics. At the age of fourteen, he commenced
his more serious labours at Magdalen College, Oxford; and
employed five years there in the study of logic and Aristotleâs Physics.
Immediately afterwards he entered into the family of William Cavendish,
Baron Hardwick, subsequently Earl of Devonshire, and became
tutor to his eldest son. The companion alike of his sports and his
studies, Hobbes presently acquired the affection of his pupil and the
confidence of the family; and the two young men (for they were of
the same age) set out together to travel in France and Italy.</p>

<p class='c000'>A free intercourse with the learned men of other countries enlarged
the mind of Hobbes, and opened new channels to his investigation. And
it appears, in the first instance, that when he beheld the contempt in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>which the subjects of his academical industry were generally held, he
turned from them to the more diligent study of Greek and Latin.
Nor was it his object alone to become master of the languages, but
also to meditate on the invaluable records of the history and the
wisdom of the ancients. He employed his leisure hours in the translation
of Thucydides; and he published it in the year 1628, to the
end (says his contemporary biographer), that the absurdities of the
democratical Athenians might become known to his own fellow-citizens.
This was the first of his publications; and it may have been
that perhaps to which, in later life, he attached the least importance.
Yet has it so fallen out, that after a lapse of two long centuries of
slowly progressive knowledge and wisdom, his other works are for the
most part consigned to the shelves of the profound and curious student,
while the âTranslation of Thucydidesâ is familiar to the acquaintance
and respect of every scholar.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is related that Hobbes, while yet a youth, was present at an
assembly of several eminent men of letters, when one of them asked,
in a contemptuous manner, <em>And what is sensation?</em> No one attempted
to make any reply; and the question was thus silently
acknowledged to be inscrutable. This piqued his curiosity and his
pride; for he was astonished that those, who through their pretensions
to wisdom so despised others, should be ignorant of the nature of their
own senses. Accordingly he directed his deepest attention to that
inquiry. The first result of his meditation was this position: that if
all things were at <em>rest</em>, they would part with all their qualities.
Hence, in his mind, it followed, that all the principles of natural
science, including the senses of all animated things and all bodily
affections, depended on the varieties of <em>motion</em>; and to these, rather
than to any inherent or occult qualities, he referred all the phenomena
of physics.</p>

<p class='c000'>This his system of physics is amply developed in the first section
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Corpore</span>) of his book of the âElements of Philosophy;â which
failed not to gain him a celebrity more than proportionate to the
number of his proselytes. For many admired his ingenuity who
did not adopt his conclusions. In conjunction with these pursuits,
Hobbes engaged with zeal in the study of mathematics. He flattered
himself that he had discovered how to square the circle, and published
several treatises in relation to that celebrated problem, which at the
time gained for him considerable reputation. In 1647 he was appointed
mathematical tutor to the Prince of Wales. He engaged in
a long mathematical controversy with Dr. Wallis, of which an amusing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>account will be found in DâIsraeliâs âQuarrels of Authors,â vol. 3.
Wallis, however, was an adversary entirely above Hobbesâ strength in
this department of science.</p>

<p class='c000'>If Hobbes had confined his exertions to the pursuits of classical
literature and physical philosophy, he would have spent a more peaceful,
and therefore to him a happier, existence. But in the tumultuous
times in which he lived, with a mind habituated to deep investigations,
it was scarcely possible that he should do otherwise than fix his attention
on the political phenomena which were passing before him, and
endeavour to trace their causes and solve their difficulties. After a
residence of three years in England, he returned to Paris in 1640,
and enjoyed the society of some of the distinguished men who were
collected around Cardinal Richelieu. There he wrote his first political
work, the book <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Cive</span></cite>, which he published in 1646. He then
proceeded to compose a much more elaborate treatise on the same
subject, which he published in England in the year 1651; this was
his <em>Leviathan</em>âa name associated with that of Hobbes in the mind
of every reader, though the <em>peculiar</em> principles which are embodied
under it are now known to few. Suffice it here to say, that the object
of this work was to give a decided support to the monarchical institution:
to show that there could be no safety without peace,
no peace without a strong government; that arms and money were
the elements which alone could give that strength; that even arms
will scarcely avail to this end, unless placed in a single hand, or if
opposed (as is the case in religious dissension), by motives and principles
which do not terminate in this world.</p>

<p class='c000'>Political researches in that age necessarily involved theological, or
at least ecclesiastical, principles; and Hobbes had not feared to denounce
some of the antient usurpations of the clergy, and to pronounce
religious concord to be absolutely essential to the civil happiness of a
people: and while he broached some principles not well pleasing to
the pretensions of the hierarchy of the day, he advanced others
which were thought to end, by no violent interpretation, in absolute
infidelity. Accordingly, the theologians assailed him from every
quarter; and his work, while it divided learned laymen, some of
whom thought it a marvel of political genius, others a dangerous and
unseemly monster, was condemned by the unanimous indignation of
the ecclesiastical body. The churchmen of Rome united in hostility
with those of England against doctrines which were dangerous to the
common prerogatives of the whole order, if not to the integrity of
religion itself. The latter, being more closely attacked, were more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>violent in their enmity. They denounced the opinions as false and
heretical; and the divines of Cambridge went so far as publicly to
stigmatize the author as an atheist. Besides this, he did not even
escape the charges of being ill disposed to royalty, and a disguised
adversary to the party of the king. These calumnies (such at least
he constantly asserted both to be,) deprived him of the patronage of
the Court, and seemed at one time even to have endangered his
personal safety; insomuch that, under the Commonwealth, he found
it expedient to escape from his enemies at Paris, and take refuge
among those, whose enmity he had rather deserved, the republicans
of England. He escaped however the fate, so common to men of
moderation in violent times, of being persecuted by both parties; and
only sustained the animosity of that which he had intended to serve.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hobbes was a decided Episcopalian. He studied in all matters
to conform both to the doctrines and the ceremonies of the church
established; and avoided, even with a feeling of dislike, the conventicles
of the Puritans. Still less did he incline, on the other hand, to
the Roman Catholic faith. During a dangerous illness, which he
suffered with great firmness at Paris, when he was supposed to be on
the point of death, an intimate friend, named Mersenne, a learned Franciscan,
approached him with spiritual consolation, and pressed him to
depart in communion with the Roman church. Hobbes calmly replied,
âFather, I have long ago considered all those matters well, and it
would trouble me to reconsider them now. You can entertain me on
some more agreeable subject. When did you see Gassendi?â</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet neither his unmoved adhesion to Protestantism, nor even his
affection for episcopal government, could disarm the wrath of the
theologians, who continued to wage an unsparing warfare against
him, and to inflict on his reputation, and even on his fortunes, such
mischief as they were able. On the other hand, his singular qualities
and talents failed not to procure him many powerful protectors;
and he stood so balanced (says his biographer) between his friends
and his enemies, that the former were just strong enough to prevent
his destruction, the latter to obstruct his advancement. So that he
continued, with a mighty reputation and a slender fortune, to remain,
even to the end of his days, under the same noble patronage, under
which his first distinctions had been acquired.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in this comparative obscurity he was consoled by the society of
the learned, the courtesy of the great, and the admiration of almost all
men. Among his personal friends or acquaintances were numbered
Francis Bacon of Verulam, Ben Jonson (who is said to have revised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>his Translation of Thucydides), the astronomer Galileo, the antiquarian
Selden, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Harvey, physician to
Charles I., Des Cartes, Gassendi; and his praises were celebrated by
the contemporary muse of Cowley. He was sought by distinguished
foreigners who visited England, even nobles and ambassadors; especially
by Cosmo deâ Medici, then Prince, afterwards Duke of Tuscany,
who offered him ample proofs of his esteem; and there were many
among his own compatriots who received his opinions with respect,
if not with favour.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the long period of his declining life, Hobbes is related to
have pursued with most assiduity his studies in natural philosophy;
but the publications of his old age (if we except the Decameron
Physiologicum, published in 1676) rather indicate a return to his
earliest tastes, which inclined, we are told, to history and poetry. At
the age of about 80, he wrote, in English, the <em>Behemoth</em>, or History
of the Civil Wars between Charles and the Parliament; besides a long
Latin poem on the origin and increase of the pontifical power. At
about 86, he translated the Odyssey into English verse, and the Iliad
at 87: and he persevered for the four following years, which were his
last, in the same peaceful course of literary recreation. A list of his
works, forty-two in number, is given in Chalmersâ âBiographical
Dictionary:â the great majority of them are forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>He died towards the end of the year 1679, and was buried at
Hault-Bucknall, close by the grave of his faithful patroness, the
Countess of Devonshire. Respecting his personal character and conversation
it is recorded, that he was agreeable and courteous in his
familiar intercourse with all, those alone excepted who approached
him for the mere purpose of disputation: and these he treated with
more severity than was necessary. Above all things, he detested
theological controversy, and always strove to turn his hearers away
from it to the exercise of piety and the practice of Christian morality.
His favourite authors were Homer, Virgil, Thucydides, and Euclid:
but his reading was not extensive; as he thought the careful meditation
on a few good works more profitable to the understanding than
a more abundant draught of indiscriminate learning; and was fond
of saying upon this subject, that if he read as much as others he should
be as ignorant as they were. He persisted in a life of celibacy, that
he might be able to pursue his studies with the less interruption. In
his disposition he was generous and charitable; but his means were
scanty: for even at the end of his life he had little else but two small
pensions, the one from the family of Devon, the other from the king.</p>

<p class='c010'>Raffaello Sanzio, the greatest of painters, was born in 1483 at
Urbino, where the house in which he passed the first years of his life
is still preserved, consecrated by a suitable inscription. His first
teacher was his father, Giovanni Sanzio, a painter who, allowing for
the technical imperfections of the time, was perhaps entitled to more
praise than Vasari has awarded him; the evidence of the remaining
works of this master has indeed led his recent biographer, Pungileoni,
to conclude that he was in many essential points equal to the
best of his contemporaries, and that his feeling for expression may
have had no unimportant influence on the genius he was destined
to instruct. An interesting altar-piece by the elder Sanzio still exists
at Urbino, in the church of S. Francesco, representing the Madonna
with St. Francis and other saints: the members of the painterâs
family are introduced, and among them the infant Raphael kneels
by his motherâs side.</p>

<p class='c000'>The silence of the historians of art as to the claims of Giovanni
Sanzio is less surprising than their omitting to notice the importance
of his city and province at the period in question. The duchy of
Urbino, at the close of the fifteenth century, could boast, as Sismondi
justly remarks, a population as warlike, and a court as lettered and
polished as any in Italy. The hereditary dukes of the ancient family
of Montefeltro ranked high among the captains of the age, and among
the distinguished patrons of science. Federigo da Montefeltro, who
died a few months before the birth of Raphael, had employed the
talents of some of the best painters of Italy, and of other countries, to
adorn his capital. Among the native artists, Fra Carnevale was one
of the earliest who attempted perspective; and to him, or at least to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>his works, Bramante, as well as Raphael, may have been indebted for
a knowledge of the rudiments of architecture; Pietro della Francesca,
whose compositions on mathematics and geometry enriched the ducal
library, was domiciliated with Giovanni Sanzio; Lucian, a painter and
architect of Dalmatia, superintended for a time the building of the
castle; but the most remarkable guest was Justus van Ghent, called
by the Italians Giusto da Guanto; a considerable work painted by
him contained portraits of the Duke Federigo and his successor Guidâ
Ubaldo, under whose auspices again the talents of the celebrated Luca
Signorelli were put in requisition. Pictures by most of these artists
probably still exist at Urbino, and undoubtedly were seen and studied
by Raphael in his early youth. Among the first reputed works of the
great artist himself, which are preserved in his native city, may be
mentioned a Madonna, originally painted on the wall in his fatherâs
house, and a holy family on wood in the church of S. Andrea.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is difficult to fix with precision the time when Raphael first
studied under Perugino; but if, as Rumohr supposes, that painter only
settled finally at Perugia about 1500, his distinguished scholar must
have joined him at the age of sixteen or seventeen, and not some years
earlier, as has been generally assumed. Even at this age it is sufficiently
wonderful that the scholar should have been fitted to select the
best qualities in his masterâs style, and indeed very soon to improve
upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the works which his native city contained, Raphael doubtless
had had opportunities of seeing the productions of Andrea Luigi
di Assisi, called Ingegno, of NiccolÃ² di Fuligno, and other painters of
the school of Umbria. Their robust style of colour, which was somewhat
modified by Perugino and Pinturicchio, is occasionally to be
traced in Raphaelâs early works. There was another quality which
Perugino, in his best time, possessed in common with other painters
of his province, and which may be said generally to characterize the
school of Umbria. This was an intensity of expression in sacred subjects
indicating a deep religious feeling; and it is so striking in the
best productions of the artist last named, that it has been considered
sufficient of itself to prove the orthodoxy of his creed, which Vasari
had called in question. The impulse was probably derived from
Assisi, where some of the earliest Italian masters had left specimens
of their powers, and the source was the doctrine of St. Francis. The
history and legends of this saint (who died in 1226), frequently
exercised the pencil of the early Italians, even to the danger of
causing Bible subjects to be neglected, from the time of Giotto to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>that of Angelico da Fiesole: but the chief influence on the school
above-mentioned is apparent rather in the treatment than in the
subject; it is to be recognised in a certain subdued earnestness of
expression, allied to the severe tenets of the saint of Assisi, and exhibiting
religion rather in its suffering than in its triumphant character.
This tendency received an additional impulse from the works
which Taddeo di Bartolo of Siena had left in Perugia and other parts
of Umbria early in the fifteenth century. The painters most remarkable
for the quality alluded to were NiccolÃ² Alunno, called NiccolÃ²
di Fuligno, and Pietro Perugino; but the same feeling had extended
itself to Francia in Bologna. The taste of the Florentine painters
on the other hand, with the single exception of Angelico da Fiesole,
had long taken another direction: their pictures of this time abound
in portraits; the saints and Madonnas of the school, those for instance
of Domenico Ghirlandajo, seem to have been taken from
common nature, and are seldom inspired with that sanctity of expression
so frequent and so remarkable in the painters above-named. In
later times, the painters of the various Italian schools, who were supposed
to copy nature with too little selection, were called <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">naturalisti</span></i>,
and, at the period alluded to, Florence may be considered comparatively
the seat of this kind of imitation; a tendency greatly owing, it
appears, to the introduction of early Flemish pictures, in which portraits
were frequent, and in which the back-ground and accessories
were treated with an attention new to the Italian painters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus it cannot but be considered among the greatest of Raphaelâs
advantages, that he had opportunities of studying in both the schools
alluded to; and in both, he of all men knew or felt what was fittest to
be imitated. The depth and fervour of expression which he imbibed
from the masters he first contemplated, and which he never relinquished,
was improved and enlivened by the accurate study of the forms and
varieties of nature to which the Florentines were devoted: again,
before Raphael arrived in Florence, Lionardo da Vinci had laid the
foundation of that profound anatomical knowledge, the only true means
of representing action, which was afterwards carried to its greatest
results in the works of Michael Angelo. The celebrated Cartoons
of both these great designers were the object of study and admiration
in Florence at the time Raphael resided there, although they were
not completed quite so soon as might be inferred from a passage in
Vasari. The importance of considering and accounting for the earliest
tendency of Raphaelâs feeling, will be apparent when we remember
that it reappeared in his later, and even in his latest, works. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Dispute of the Sacrament, his altar-pieces, and even the Cartoons,
are not Florentine in their taste, but are rather allied to the school
from which he derived his first impressions.</p>

<p class='c000'>From 1500, or perhaps a little earlier, to 1504â5, Raphael was
employed at Perugia, or at CittÃ  di Castello (a township midway
between Perugia and Urbino); his works in the latter place must,
however, have been executed after he became a pupil of Perugino, as
they clearly evince an imitation of that painterâs manner. An altar-piece,
originally in the church of S. Niccola di Tolentino, at CittÃ 
di Castello, is now in the Vatican; a Crucifixion from the church of
S. Domenico, in the same place, is in the Fesch collection at Rome;
and the celebrated Marriage of the Virgin, from the church of S.
Francesco, is at Milan. The last, which was copied almost without
alteration from a painting of Perugino, has the date 1504, and immediately
precedes Raphaelâs first visit to Florence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The works done by Raphael in Perugia were much more numerous,
to say nothing of his assistance in pictures which pass for Peruginoâs.
Among his own may be mentioned an Assumption of the
Virgin, now in the Vatican, as well as another picture of the same
subject begun by Raphael, but finished, not till after his death, by his
scholars. The fresco, in the cloister of S. Severo, at Perugia, which
resembles the upper part of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Disputa</span></i> (to be hereafter mentioned),
has the date 1505; the lower part was finished by Perugino when
very old, after Raphaelâs death. The style of this fresco bespeaks an
acquaintance with higher examples of art than Perugia contained; it
was probably done after a first visit to Florence. The interesting
picture at Blenheim, mentioned by Vasari as having been painted for
the chapel Degli Ansidei, in the church Deâ Servi at Perugia, has the
date 1505; it may be considered to be the last example of Raphaelâs
imitation of Perugino, and to mark the transition from that imitation
to the Florentine manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>While Raphael was studying at Perugia, Pinturicchio, a native of
that place, and an assistant of Perugino, was employed to paint some
subjects relating to the Life of Pius II., in the library, now the sacristy,
of the Duomo at Siena. Vasari relates, not without contradicting
himself in the separate lives of Raphael and Pinturicchio, that the latter
availed himself of his young friendâs skill in composition, in engaging
him to design the whole series of subjects; he further adds, that
Raphael accompanied Pinturicchio to Siena, but left him to proceed
to Florence, in order to see the Cartoons of Michael Angelo and
Lionardo da Vinci. The works in the sacristy at Siena appear to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>have been done before the death of Pius III., in 1503: at that time
the Cartoons in question were not completed (M. Angeloâs was not
finished and publicly shown before 1506, Vinciâs not much earlier);
and as we have before seen, Raphael was employed at CittÃ  di
Castello in 1504, probably before he had seen Florence at all.
It is however certain that Raphael made some designs for Pinturicchio,
since two small compositions, almost identical with the
frescoes at Siena, and other separate studies by his hand exist, although
various reasons, too long to adduce here, render it extremely improbable
that he was ever employed at Siena. The vast number of
works which this great man executed in his very short life, make it
sufficiently difficult to assign time enough for the production of those
that are undoubted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The amiable character, as well as the extraordinary talents of
Raphael, soon procured him the notice and admiration of the Florentine
artists. Among his chief friends were Taddeo Gaddi (in return
for whose hospitality he probably painted the Madonna del Gran
Duca and the Madonna Tempi), Ridolfo Ghirlandajo, and Fra
Bartolommeo. It would be impossible here to give a list of the works
which he executed during his residence in Florence from 1504â5 to
1508, when we find him in Rome. Some pictures were left unfinished
at the time of his departure for that city, and were completed
by Ridolfo Ghirlandajo. A picture sent to Siena, by some
supposed the Giardiniera, now at Paris, but more probably the Lanti
Madonna, was among these, as well as the Madonna painted for the
Dei family: an accurate critic, Rumohr, even supposes that the
celebrated entombment done for Perugia, which is now in the Borghese
palace in Rome, was completed from Raphaelâs designs by
Ridolfo Ghirlandajo. The number of Madonnas, portraits, and altar-pieces
produced in the three or four years of Raphaelâs residence in
Florence, must of necessity lead to the conclusion that the <em>repetitions</em>
of these works, which all pretend to originality, must have been
done by his imitators. Again Vasari states, not without some probability,
that Raphael visited his native place, and painted several
works there for the Duke Guidâ Ubaldo, during the short time above-mentioned:
and Malvasia, in his account of the Bolognese school,
enumerates various works which were unknown even to Vasari.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile Raphael reaped all the improvement which the sight
of the excellent works of art in Florence was calculated to communicate.
The inspection of the works of Michael Angelo and Lionardo
da Vinci enlarged his knowledge of form and his execution, while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>inventions of the earlier Florentine masters were diligently examined
and remembered; yet it is here important to remark, that he never
imitated even the highest examples alluded to, as he had imitated the
first models from which he studied. This is naturally to be accounted
for in some degree by the greater docility of earlier youth; but as
so much has been said of the inspiration which Raphael caught
from Michael Angelo, in Florence from a sight of the Cartoons, and
in Rome from that of the ceiling of the Capella Sistina, it is necessary
to remember that a direct imitation of Michael Angelo is no
where to be traced in Raphael, and that he seemed desirous rather of
exhibiting his own feeling as distinct from that of the great Florentine
master, than of aiming at that masterâs style.</p>

<p class='c000'>From 1508 to 1520, the year of his death, Raphael resided in
Rome. Vasari relates that Bramante, the architect of Julius II.,
being from the same city with Raphael and distantly related to him,
had recommended him to the Pope, as qualified to paint in fresco certain
rooms of the Vatican; but it was more probably Raphaelâs great
reputation, now second to none, which was the real cause of the
Popeâs notice, although Bramante may have been the medium of
communication. To the honour of Julius it should be remembered,
that he had discernment enough to fix in every instance on the best
artists of his age, and he left no means unemployed, sometimes even
to an indulgence at variance with the haughtiness of his character, to
secure their best efforts in his service.</p>

<p class='c000'>At no period of Raphaelâs laborious life were his exertions greater
than during the reign of Julius II., that is, till 1513, the year of that
pontiffâs death. The room called the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Camera della Segnatura</span>, where
the great artist began to work, was evidently planned by him as one
design, and its four walls were appropriated to four comprehensive
subjects,âtheology, philosophy, poetry, and jurisprudence. The
ceiling is occupied with single figures and subjects forming part of
the same scheme. The subject of Theology, commonly called the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Disputa</span></i>,
was begun the first, and the right hand of the upper part was
first painted. This is evident from a certain inexperience in the mechanical
process of fresco painting, which is found to disappear even
in the same work. Six of these vast subjects, besides other works,
were executed between 1508 and 1513, and the two last, the Miracle
of Bolsena and the Heliodorus, are unsurpassed in colour, as well as
in every other excellence fitted for the subject and dimensions. For
richness and force of local colour these two works have often been
compared to those of Titian; it should be added that they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>earlier in date than the finest oil pictures of Titian, and that they are
decidedly superior in colour to the frescoes by that master in Padua.
The supposition of Rumohr, that Giorgione may have seen and profited
by these specimens, is, however, not to be reconciled with the
date of that painterâs death. The impatience of the character of Julius,
who was bent on the speedy prosecution of this undertaking, makes it
probable that some works attributed by Vasari to this period were
executed later. The portrait of Julius, that of Bindo Altoviti, the
musician in the Sciarra palace, the Madonna di Fuligno, the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Madonna
della Sedia</span>, and the Vision of Ezekiel, belong however to this time.
The St. Cecilia, begun in 1513, was not sent to Bologna till some
years afterwards. In the last, the assistance of subordinate hands is
evident; and the variety of works in which Raphael was employed
under Leo X. made this practice of intrusting the execution of his
designs to others more and more necessary. Unfortunately, his grand
works, the frescoes of the Vatican, with the exception of two excellent
specimens, the Attila and the Liberation of Peter (painted immediately
after the accession of Leo), were completed very much in this way by
his scholars. Even the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Incendio del Borgo</span>, so remarkable for its
invention and composition, has but few traces of his own hand in
the execution. The frescoes of the Vatican have often been described
as exhibiting one comprehensive plan as to their meaning, but
it is well known that the subjects of the Attila and the Liberation of
Peter were suggested by incidents in the life of Leo, and consequently
that they could not have been thought of before the accession of that
pope. Of all these works the Attila is justly considered to be the
most perfect example of fresco painting, and to exhibit the greatest
command over the material; though produced after the death of
Julius, it may be regarded as the noblest result of that impulse which
the pontiffâs energy had communicated to Raphael. The character of
Leo X., as a protector of art, has been perhaps sometimes too favourably
represented. More educated than his predecessor, he loved the
refinement which the arts and letters imparted to his court; but he
had no deep interest, like Julius, in inciting such men as Raphael
and Michael Angelo to do their utmost under his auspices. Whether
from the indifference of Leo, or from his neglecting, as Vasari hints,
to discharge his pecuniary debts to Raphael, we soon find the painter
employed in various other works, and the remaining frescoes of the
Vatican bear evidence of the frequent employment of other hands.
Many works of minor importance in the same palace were entirely
executed by his assistants.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>The celebrated Cartoons were designs for tapestries, of which more
than twenty of various sizes are preserved in the Vatican. The Cartoons,
it may be inferred, were equally numerous, but seven only,
now fit Hampton Court, remain entire. A portion of another was
bequeathed by the late Prince Hoare to the Foundling Hospital,
where it is now to be seen. These works owed their existence to
the Popeâs love of magnificence rather than to a true taste for art; but
although destined for a merely ornamental purpose, some of the designs
are among the very finest of Raphaelâs inventions, and a few
may have been, at least in part, executed by his hand. The Ananias,
the Charge to Peter, the Paul and Barnabas at Lystra, and the Paul
preaching at Athens, are generally considered to have the greatest
pretensions to this additional interest. The fine portrait of Leo with
the Cardinals deâ Medici and deâ Rossi completes the list of larger
works undertaken for the Pope, but the many designs by Raphael
from classical or mythological subjects may be supposed to have been
also made at the suggestion of the pontiff. In obedience to his wishes,
Raphael undertook the inspection of the ancient Roman monuments,
and superintended the improvements of St. Peterâs. Among the numerous
and extensive works done for other employers may be mentioned
the Sybils in the Chiesa della Pace, the frescoes from Apuleiusâs
story of Cupid and Psyche in the palace of Agostino Chigi, called the
Farnesina, where the so-called Galatea was the beginning of another
Cyclus from the same fable, the Madonna del Pesce, the Madonna di
S. Sisto, and the Spasimo di Sicilia. Many a palace in the neighbourhood
of Rome still exhibits remains of frescoes for which Raphael
at least furnished the designs; and his own Casino, near the more
modern Villa Borghese, may retain traces of his hand, but it is now
fast falling to decay. A long list of portraits might be added to the
above works, together with many interesting designs in architecture,
and even some productions in sculpture. In reviewing the amazing
number of works attributed to Raphael, it must not however be forgotten
that many are his only in the invention, and some pictures that
bear his name may have been even designed as well as finished by his
imitators. The Flemish copies of Raphael are frequent, and are to
be detected, among other indications, by their extreme smoothness;
the contemporary imitations, especially those of the earlier style of the
master, by Domenico Alfani and Vincenzo di S. Geminiano, are much
less easily distinguished. The question respecting the Urbino earthenware
may be considered to have been set at rest by Passeri (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Storia
delle pitture in Maiolica<a id='t37'></a> di Pesaro e di altri luoghi della Provincia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Metaurense</span>). From this inquiry, it appears, first, that the art of
painting this ware had not arrived at perfection till twenty years after
Raphaelâs death: and secondly, that about that time Guidâ Ubaldo II.
(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">della Rovere</span>) collected engravings after Raphael, and even original
designs by him, and had them copied in the Urbino manufactory.
Battista Franco at one time superintended the execution, and one of
the artists was called Raffaello del Colle; his name may perhaps
occasionally be inscribed on the Urbino ware, but the initials O. F.
(Orazio Fontana) are the most frequent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Transfiguration was the last oil picture of importance on which
Raphael was employed; it was unfinished at his death, and was afterwards
completed, together with various other works, by his scholars.
The last and worst misstatement of Vasari cannot be passed over, for
unfortunately, none of the biographerâs mistakes have been oftener
repeated than that which ascribes the death of this great man to the
indulgence of his passion for the Fornarina. Cardinal Antonelli was
in possession of an original document, first published by Cancellieri,
which assigns a different, and a much more probable, cause for
Raphaelâs death; it thus concludes,ââLife in him (Raphael) seemed
to inform a most fragile bodily structure, for he was all mind; and
moreover, his physical forces were much impaired by the extraordinary
exertions he had gone through, and which it is wonderful to
think he could have made in so short a life. Being then in a very
delicate state of health, he received orders one day while at the Farnesina
to repair to the court; not to lose time, he ran all the way to
the Vatican, and arrived there heated and breathless; there the sudden
chill of the vast rooms, where he was obliged to stand long consulting
on the alterations of St. Peterâs, checked the perspiration, and he was
presently seized with an indisposition. On his return home, he was
attacked with a fever, which ended in his death.â Raphael was born
and died on Good Friday. Some of his biographers have hence,
through an oversight, asserted that he lived exactly thirty-seven years.
He was born March 28, 1483, and died April 6, 1520. He was
buried in the Pantheon, now the church of Sta. Maria ad Martyres,
in a niche or chapel which he had himself endowed. His remains
have been lately found there.</p>

<p class='c000'>QuatremÃ¨re de Quincyâs âHistoire de la Vie et des Ouvrages de
Rafael, etc. Paris, 1824,â has been improved and superseded by the
notes to the Italian translation of Longhena, Milan, 1829. Pungileoni,
the author of the â<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Elogio Storico di Giovanni Santi, Urbino, 1822</span>,â
has been long employed in preparing a life of Raphael. The observations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>of Rumohr, in the third volume of his â<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Italienische Forschungen,
Berlin, 1831</span>,â are original and valuable. A few interesting facts will
be found in Feaâs â<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Notizie intorno Raffaele Sanzio, Rome 1822.</span>â
The author, however, fails to prove the regularity of Leoâs payments
to Raphael, since the latest document concerning the frescoes in the
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Stanze</span></i> has the date 1514.</p>

<p class='c000'>The engraving is from a miniature after the portrait by Raphael
himself, in his first manner, cut from the stucco of a wall at Urbino,
which forms the chief attraction of the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Camera diâ ritratti</span> at Florence.
The head engraved by Morghen, and so generally known, represents
the features of Bindo Altoviti, which do not even resemble in a single
point those of Raphael. The notion arose solely from a passage in
Vasariâs Lives:ââ<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">E a Bindo Altoviti fece il ritratto suo</span></i>;â for Bindo
Altoviti he did his portrait (not <em>his own</em>): these words were distorted
by the Editor Bottari in a marginal note; but the error has been
decisively exposed by Missirini and others, whose account is every
where received in Italy. Nor does it appear that the Tuscans in
general fell into the mistake, for the portrait now given, and not,
as Bottari asserts, the Altoviti portrait, is engraved in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Museum
Florentinum</span></i>.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>KNOX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>John Knox was born in East Lothian, in 1505, probably at the
village of Gifford, but, according to some accounts, at the small town
of Haddington, in the grammar-school of which he received the rudiments
of his education. His parents were of humble rank, but sufficiently
removed from want to support their son at the University of
St. Andrewâs, which Knox entered about the year 1524. He passed
with credit through his academical course, and took orders at the age
of twenty-five, if not sooner. In his theological reading, he was led
by curiosity to examine the works of ancient authors quoted by the
scholastic divines. These gave him new views of religion, and led
him on to the perusal of the scriptures themselves. The change in
his opinions appears to have commenced about 1535. It led him to
recommend to others, as well as to practise, a more rational course of
study than that prescribed by the ancient usage of the University.
This innovation brought him under suspicion of being attached to
the principles of the Reformation, which was making secret progress
in Scotland: and, having ventured to censure the corruptions which
prevailed in the Church, he found it expedient to quit St. Andrewâs
in 1542, and return to the south of Scotland, where he openly avowed
his adherence to the Reformed doctrines.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having cut himself off from the emoluments of the Established
Church, Knox engaged as tutor in the family of Douglas of Langniddrie,
a gentleman of East Lothian. As a man of known ability,
and as a priest, he was especially obnoxious to the hierarchy; and it is
said that Archbishop Beatoun sought his life by private assassination,
as well as openly under colour of the law. At Easter, 1547, Knox,
with many other Protestants, took refuge in the castle of St. Andrewâs,
which was seized and held, after the archbishopâs murder, by the band
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>of conspirators who had done the deed. He here continued his usual
course of instruction to his pupils, combined with public reading and
explanation of the scriptures to those who sought his assistance. His
talents pointed him out as a fitting person for the ministry; but he
was very reluctant to devote himself to that important charge, and was
only induced to do so, after a severe internal struggle, by a solemn call
from the minister and the assembled congregation. He distinguished
himself during his short abode at St. Andrewâs by zeal, boldness, and
success in preaching. But in the following July the castle surrendered;
and, by a scandalous violation of the articles of capitulation, the garrison
were made prisoners of war, and subjected to great and unusual
ill-treatment. Knox, with many others, was placed in a French
galley, and compelled to labour like a slave at the oar. His health
was greatly injured by the hardships which he underwent in that worst
of prisons; but his spirit rose triumphant over suffering. During
this period he committed to writing an abstract of the doctrines which
he had preached, which he found means to convey to his friends in
Scotland, with an earnest exhortation to persevere in the faith through
persecution and trial. He obtained liberty in February, 1549, but
by what means is not precisely known.</p>

<p class='c000'>At that time, under the direction of Cranmer, and with the zealous
concurrence of the young King Edward VI., the Reformation in
England was advancing with rapid pace. Knox repaired thither, as
to the safest harbour; and in the dearth of able and earnest preachers
which then existed, he found at once a welcome and active employment.
The north was appointed to be the scene of his usefulness, and
he continued to preach there, living chiefly at Berwick and Newcastle,
till the end of 1552. He was then summoned to London, to appear
before the Privy Council on a frivolous charge, of which he was
honourably acquitted. The King was anxious to secure his services
to the English Church, and caused the living of All Hallows, in
London, and even a bishopric, to be offered him. But Knox had
conscientious scruples to some points of the English establishment.
He continued, however, to preach, itinerating through the country,
until, after the accession of Mary, the exercise of the Protestant
religion was forbidden by act of parliament, December 20, 1553.
Shortly afterwards he yielded to the importunity of his friends, and
consulted his own safety by retiring to France. Previous to his departure,
he solemnised his marriage with Miss Bowes, a Yorkshire
lady of good family, to whom he had been some time engaged.</p>

<p class='c000'>Knox took up his abode in the first instance at Dieppe, but he soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>went to Geneva, and there made acquaintance with Calvin, whom he
loved and venerated, and followed more closely than any others of the
fathers of the Reformation in his views both of doctrine and ecclesiastical
discipline. Towards the close of 1554 he was invited by a congregation
of English exiles resident at Frankfort to become one of
their pastors. Internal discords, chiefly concerning the ritual and
matters of ceremonial observance, in which, notwithstanding the
severe and uncomplying temper usually ascribed to him, no blame
seems justly due to Knox, soon forced him to quit this charge, and he
returned to Geneva; where he spent more than a year in a learned
leisure, peculiarly grateful to him after the troubled life which he
had led so long. But in August, 1555, moved by the favourable
aspect of the time, and by the entreaties of his family, from whom he
had now been separated near two years, he returned to Scotland, and
was surprised and rejoiced at the extraordinary avidity with which his
preaching was attended. He visited various districts, both north and
south, and won over two noblemen, who became eminent supporters
of the Reformation, the heir-apparent of the earldom of Argyle, and
Lord James Stuart, afterwards Earl of Murray. But in the middle
of these successful labours he received a call from an English congregation
at Geneva to become their pastor; and he appears to have felt
it a duty to comply with their request. It would seem more consonant
to his character to have remained in Scotland, to watch over the seed
which he had sown, and that his own country had the most pressing
claim upon his services. But the whole tenor of his life warrants the
belief that he was actuated by no unworthy or selfish motives; and
in the absence of definite information, some insight into the nature of
his feelings may probably be gained from a letter addressed to some
friends in Edinburgh, in March, 1557. âAssure of that, that whenever
a greater number among you shall call upon me than now hath
bound me to serve them, by His grace it shall not be the fear of
punishment, neither yet of the death temporal, that shall impede
my coming to you.â He quitted Scotland in July, 1556.</p>

<p class='c000'>During this absence Knox maintained a frequent correspondence
with his brethren in Scotland, and both by exhortation and by his
advice upon difficult questions submitted to his judgment, was still of
material service in keeping alive their spirit. Two of his works composed
during this period require mention; his share in the English
translation of the Scriptures, commonly called the âGeneva Bible,â
and the âBlast of the Trumpet against the monstrous Regimen of
Women,â a treatise expressly directed against the government of Mary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>of England, but containing a bold and unqualified enunciation of the
principle, that to admit a woman to sovereignty is contrary to nature,
justice, and the revealed will of God. In January, 1559, at the invitation
of the leading persons of the Protestant congregation, he
again returned to Scotland. Matters at this time were drawing to a
crisis. The Queen Regent, after temporising while the support of a
large and powerful party was essential to her, had thrown off disguise,
and openly avowed her determination to use force for the suppression
of heresy: while the leading Protestants avowed as plainly their resolution
of protecting their preachers; and becoming more and more
sensible of their own increasing strength, resolved to abolish the
Roman, and set up the Reformed method of worship in those places
to which their influence or feudal power extended. St. Andrewâs was
fixed on for the commencement of the experiment; and under the
protection of the Earl of Argyle and Lord James Stuart, Prior of
St. Andrewâs, Knox, who on his landing had been proclaimed a rebel
and outlaw, undertook to preach publicly in the cathedral of that city.
The archbishop sent word that he should be fired upon if he ventured
to appear in the pulpit, and as that prelate was supported by a stronger
force than the retinue of the Protestant noblemen, they thought it best
that he should abstain at this time from thus exposing his life. Knox
remained firm to his purpose. After reminding them that he had first
preached the Gospel in that church, of the sufferings of his captivity,
and of the confident hope which he had expressed to many that he
should again perform his high mission in that same church, he besought
them not to stand in the way when Providence had brought
him to the spot. The archbishopâs proved to be an empty threat.
Knox preached for four successive days without interruption, and
with such effect, that the magistrates and the inhabitants agreed to
set up the reformed worship in their town; the monasteries were
destroyed, and the churches stripped of images and pictures. Both
parties now rose in arms. During the contest which ensued, Knox
was a chief agent in conducting the correspondence between Elizabeth
and the Lords of the Congregation. The task suited neither his profession
nor his character, and he rejoiced when he was relieved from
it. In July, 1560, a treaty was concluded with the King and Queen
of France, by which the administration of the Queen Regent was terminated;
and in August a parliament was convoked, which abolished
the papal jurisdiction, prohibited the celebration of mass, and rescinded
the laws enacted against Protestant worship.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the persecuted and endangered teacher of a proscribed religion,
Knox had now become, not indeed the head, but a leader and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>venerated father of an Established Church. He was at once appointed
the Protestant minister of Edinburgh, and his influence ceased not to
be felt from this time forward in all things connected with the Church,
and in many particulars of civil policy. Still his anxieties were far
from an end. Many things threatened and impeded the infant Church.
Far from acquiescing in the recent acts of the parliament, the young
King and Queen of France were bent on putting down the rebellion,
as they termed it, in Scotland by force of arms. The death of
Francis put an end to that danger; but another, no less serious, was
opened by the arrival of Mary in August, 1561, to assume her paternal
sovereignty, with a fixed determination of reviving the supremacy
of the religion in which she had been brought up, and to which
she was devotedly attached. There were also two subjects upon
which Knox felt peculiarly anxious, and in which he was thwarted
by the lukewarmness, as he considered it, of the legislature,âthe
establishment of a strict and efficacious system of church discipline,
and the entire devotion of the wealth of the Catholic priesthood to
the promotion of education, and the maintenance of the true religion.
In both these points he was thwarted by the indifference or interestedness
of the nobility, who had possessed themselves, to a large amount,
of the lands and tithes formerly enjoyed by monasteries.</p>

<p class='c000'>It soon became evident that the Queen disliked and feared Knox.
She regarded his âBlast against the Regimen of Womenâ as an attack
upon her own right to the throne; and this is not surprising,
though Knox always declared that book to be levelled solely against
the late Queen of England, and professed his perfect readiness to submit
to Maryâs authority in all things lawful, and to wave all discussion
or allusion to the obnoxious tenet. His freedom of speech in the
pulpit was another constant source of offence; and it is not to be
denied that, although the feelings of that age warranted a greater latitude
than would now be tolerated in a teacher of religion, his energetic
and severe temper led him to use violent and indiscreet language
in speaking of public men and public things. For Mary herself he
prayed in terms which, however fitting for a minister to employ
towards one of his flock whom he regarded to be in deadly and pernicious
error, a queen could hardly be expected to endure from a subject
without anger. Accordingly, he was several times summoned to
her presence, to apologise or answer for his conduct. The narrations
of these interviews are very interesting: they show the ascendancy
which he had gained over the haughty spirit of the Queen, and at the
same time exonerate him from the charge urged by her apologists of
having treated her with personal disrespect, and even brutality. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>expressed uncourtly opinions in plain and severe language; farther
than this he neither violated the courtesy due from man to woman,
nor the respect due from a subject to a superior. In addition to the
causes of offence already specified, he had remonstrated, from her first
landing, against the toleration of the mass in her own chapel. And
at a later time, he spoke so freely concerning the probable consequence
to the Reformed Church from her marrying a Papist, that in reprimanding
and remonstrating with him she burst into a passion of tears.
He remained unmoved, protesting that he saw her Majestyâs tears with
reluctance, but was constrained, since he had given her no just ground
of offence, rather to sustain her tears than to hurt his conscience, and
betray the commonwealth through his silence. This interview is one
of the things upon which Mr. Hume has sought to raise a prejudice
against the reformer in his partial account of this period.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the nobility who had aided in the establishment of the
Reformation, gained over either by the fascination of Maryâs beauty
and manners, or by the still more cogent appeal of personal interest,
were far from seconding Knoxâs efforts, or partaking in his apprehensions.
The Earl of Murray was so far won over to adopt a temporising
and conciliatory policy, that a quarrel ensued in 1563 between
him and Knox, which lasted for two years, until quenched, as Knox
expresses it, by the water of affliction. Maitland of Lethington, once
an active Reformer, a man of powerful and versatile talents, who was
now made Secretary of State, openly espoused the Queenâs wishes.
In the summer of 1563, Knox was involved in a charge of high
treason, for having addressed a circular to the chief Protestant gentlemen,
requesting them to attend the trial of two persons accused of
having created a riot at the Queenâs chapel. It appears that he held
an especial commission from the General Assembly to summon such
meetings, when occasion seemed to him to require them. Upon this
charge of treasonably convoking the lieges, he was brought before the
privy council. Murray and Maitland were earnest to persuade him
into submission and acknowledgment of error. Knox, however, with
his usual firmness and uprightness, refused positively to confess a
fault when he was conscious of none, and defended himself with so
much power, that by the voice of a majority of the council he was
declared free of all blame.</p>

<p class='c000'>In March, 1564, more than three years after the death of his first
wife, Knox was again married to a daughter of Lord Ochiltree, a
zealous Protestant. Throughout that year and the following, he continued
to preach as usual. Meanwhile, the Protestant establishment,
though confirmed by the parliament, remained still unrecognised by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the Queen, whose hasty marriage to Lord Henry Darnley in July,
1565, increased the alarm with which her conduct had already inspired
the Reformers. But early in the following year, when Mary,
in conjunction with her uncles of the House of Lorrain, had planned
the formal re-establishment of Catholicism, her dissensions with her
husband led to the assassination of Rizzio, and in rapid succession to
the murder of Darnley, her marriage with Bothwell, and the train of
events which ended in her formal deposition and the coronation of her
infant son James VI. It is denied that Knox was privy to the assassination
of Rizzio, and the tenor of his actions warrants us in disbelieving
that he would have been an accomplice in any deed of blood;
but after that event, he spoke of it in terms of satisfaction, indiscreet,
liable to perversion, and unbecoming a Christian preacher. The
Queenâs resentment for this and other reasons became so warm against
him, that it was judged proper for him to retire from Edinburgh.
He preached at the coronation of James VI. After Mary was made
prisoner and confined at Lochleven, he, in common with most of the
ministers and the great body of the people, insisted strongly on the
duty of bringing her to trial for the crimes of murder and adultery,
and of inflicting capital punishment if her guilt were proved.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the short regency of Murray, Knox had the satisfaction, not
only of being freed from the personal disquietudes which had been his
portion almost through life, but of seeing the interests of the Church,
if not maintained to the full extent which he could wish, at least treated
with respect, and advocated as far as the crooked course of state-policy
would permit. The murder of that distinguished nobleman, January
23, 1570, affected Knox doubly, as the premature decease of a loved
and esteemed friend, and as a public calamity to church and state.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the following October he suffered a slight fit of apoplexy, from
which however he soon recovered so far as to resume his Sunday
preachings. But the troubled times which followed on the death of
the Regent Murray denied to him in Edinburgh that repose which his
infirmities demanded, and in May, 1571, he was reluctantly induced
to retire from his ministry and again to seek a refuge in St. Andrewâs.
Nor was his residence in that city one of peace or ease, for he was
troubled by a party favourable to the Queenâs interests, especially by
that Archibald Hamilton who afterwards apostatised to the Roman
Catholic Church and became his bitter calumniator; and he was placed
in opposition to the Regent Morton with respect to the filling up of
vacant bishoprics and the disposal of church property, which, far from
being applied to the maintenance of religion and the diffusion of education,
was still in great measure monopolised by the nobility. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>August, 1572, his health being rapidly declining, he returned to
Edinburgh at the earnest request of his congregation, who longed
to hear his voice in the pulpit once more. He felt death to be nigh
at hand, and was above all things anxious to witness the appointment
of a zealous and able successor to the important station in the ministry
which he filled. This was done to his satisfaction. On Sunday,
November 9, he preached and presided at the installation of his successor,
James Lawson, and he never after quitted his own house.
He sickened on the 11th, and expired November 24, 1572, after a
fortnightâs illness, in which he displayed unmixed tranquillity, and
assured trust in a happy futurity, through the promises of the Gospel
which he had preached. It is the more necessary to state this, because
his calumniators dared to assert that his death was accompanied by
horrid prodigies, and visible marks of divine reprobation. The same
tales have been related of Luther and Calvin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Knoxâs moral character we may safely pronounce to have been unblemished,
notwithstanding the outrageous charges of dissolute conversation
which have been brought by some writers against him,âcalumnies
equally levelled against Beza, Calvin, and other fathers of
the Reformation, and which bear their own refutation in their extravagance.
As a preacher, he was energetic and effective, and uncommonly
powerful in awakening the negligent or the hardened conscience.
As a Reformer and leader of the Church, he was fitted for
the stormy times and the turbulent and resolute people among whom
his lot was cast, by the very qualities which have been made a reproach
to him in a more polished age, and by a less zealous generation. He
was possessed of strong natural talents, and a determined will which
shunned neither danger nor labour. He was of middle age when he
began the study of Greek, and it was still later in life when he acquired
the Hebrew language,âtasks of no small difficulty when we consider
the harassed and laborious tenor of his life. No considerations of temporising
prudence could seduce him into the compromise of an important
principle; no thought of personal danger could make him shrink
when called to confront it. His deep sense and resolute discharge of
duty, coupled with a natural fire and impetuosity of temper, sometimes
led him into severity. But that his disposition was deeply affectionate
is proved by his private correspondence; and that his severity proceeded
from no acerbity of temper may be inferred from his having
employed his powerful influence as a mediator for those who had borne
arms against his party, and from his having never used it to avenge an
injury. The best apology for his occasional harshness is that contained
in the words of his own dying address to the elders of his church
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>as quoted by Dr. MâCrie. âI know that many have frequently complained,
and do still loudly complain, of my too great severity; but
God knows that my mind was always void of hatred to the persons of
those against whom I thundered the severest judgments. I cannot
deny but that I felt the greatest abhorrence at the sins in which they
indulged; but still I kept this one thing in view, that, if possible, I
might gain them to the Lord. What influenced me to utter whatever
the Lord put into my mouth so boldly, and without respect of persons,
was a reverential fear of my God, who called and of His grace appointed
me to be a steward of divine mysteries, and a belief that He will demand
an account of the manner in which I have discharged the trust
committed to me, when I shall at last stand before His tribunal.â</p>

<p class='c000'>A list of Knoxâs printed works, nineteen in number, is given by
Dr. MâCrie at the end of his notes. They consist chiefly of short religious
pieces, exhortations, and sermons. In addition to those more
important books which we have already noticed, his âHistory of the
Church of Scotlandâ requires mention. The best edition is that
printed at Edinburgh in 1732, which contains a life of the author,
the âRegimen of Women,â and some<a id='t48'></a> other pieces. Dr. MâCrieâs
admirable âLife of Knoxâ will direct the reader to the original
sources of the history of this period.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>A. SMITH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Adam Smith was born June 5, 1723, at Kirkaldy, in the county of
Fife, where his father held the place of comptroller of the customs.
Being a posthumous and only child, he became the sole object of his
widowed motherâs tenderness and solicitude; and this was increased
by the delicacy of his constitution. Upon her devolved the sole charge
of his education; and the value of her care may be estimated from the
uninterrupted harmony and deep mutual affection which united them,
unchilled, to the end of life. He was remarkable for his love of
reading and the excellence of his memory, even at the early age when
she first placed him at the grammar-school of Kirkaldy, where he
won the affection of his companions by his amiable disposition, though
the weakness of his frame hindered him from joining in their sports.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the age of fourteen he was sent to the University of Glasgow,
from which, at the end of three years, he was removed to Baliol
College, Oxford, in order to qualify himself for taking orders in the
English Church. Mathematics and natural philosophy seem to have
been his favourite pursuits at Glasgow; but at Oxford he devoted all
his leisure hours to belles-lettres, and the moral and political sciences.
Among these political economy cannot be reckoned; for at that period
it was unknown even in name: still, in such studies, and by the
sedulous improvement of his understanding, he was laying the foundations
of his immortal work. He remained seven years at Oxford,
without conceiving, as may be inferred from some passages in the
âWealth of Nations,â any high respect for the system of education
then pursued in the University; and, having given up all thoughts
of taking orders, he returned to his motherâs house at Kirkaldy, and
devoted himself entirely to literature and science. In 1748 he removed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>to Edinburgh, where, under Lord Kamesâs patronage, he delivered a
course of lectures on rhetoric and belles-lettres. These were never
published; and, with other papers, were destroyed by Smith a short
time before his death. Dr. Blair, in the well-known course which
he delivered ten years afterwards on the same subject, acknowledges
how greatly he was indebted to his predecessor, and how largely he
had borrowed from him.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1751 Mr. Smith was elected Professor of Logic in the University
of Glasgow, and in the following year he was transferred to
the chair of Moral Philosophy, which he filled during thirteen years.
The following account of his lectures is given by Professor Millar.
âHis course of lectures on this subject was divided into four parts.
The first contained natural theology, in which he considered the
proofs of the being and attributes of God, and those principles of the
human mind upon which religion is founded. The second comprehended
ethics, strictly so called, and consisted chiefly of the doctrines
which he afterwards published in his âTheory of Moral Sentiments.â
In the third part he treated more at length of that branch of morality
which relates to justice, and which, being susceptible of precise and
accurate rules, is for that reason capable of a full and particular
explanation.... In the last part of his lectures he examined
those political regulations which are founded, not on the principle of
justice, but on that of expediency, and which are calculated to increase
the riches, the power, and the prosperity of a state. Under this view,
he considered the political institutions relating to commerce, to
finances, to ecclesiastical and military establishments. What he
delivered on these subjects contained the substance of the work he
afterwards published under the title of âAn Inquiry into the Nature
and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.ââ</p>

<p class='c000'>âThere was no situation in which the abilities of Dr. Smith appeared
to greater advantage than as a professor. In delivering his lectures,
he trusted almost entirely to extemporary elocution. His manner,
though not graceful, was plain and unaffected; and as he seemed to
be always interested in the subject, he never failed to interest his
hearers. Each discourse consisted of several distinct propositions,
which he successively endeavoured to prove and to illustrate. These
propositions, when announced in general terms, had, from their extent,
not unfrequently something of the air of a paradox. In his attempts
to explain them, he often appeared at first not to be sufficiently possessed
of the subject, and spoke with some hesitation. As he advanced,
however, the matter seemed to crowd upon him, his manner became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>warm and animated, and his expression easy and fluent. In points
susceptible of controversy, you could easily discern that he secretly
conceived an opposition to his opinions, and that he was led upon this
account to support them with greater energy and vehemence. By the
fulness and variety of his illustrations, the subject gradually swelled
in his hands, and acquired a dimension which, without a tedious repetition
of the same views, was calculated to seize the attention of his
audience, and to afford them pleasure as well as instruction in following
the same object through all the diversity of shades and aspects in
which it was presented, and afterwards in tracing it backwards to
that original proposition or general truth from which this beautiful
train of speculation had proceeded.â</p>

<p class='c000'>âHis reputation as a professor was accordingly raised very high,
and a multitude of students from a great distance resorted to the
University merely upon his account. Those branches of science which
he taught became fashionable at this place, and his opinions were the
chief topics of discussion in clubs and literary societies. Even the
small peculiarities in his pronunciation or manner of speaking became
frequently the objects of imitation.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Smith published his âTheory of Moral Sentimentsâ in 1759. The
fundamental principle of this work, we use the summary of Mr. Macculloch,
is that â<em>sympathy</em> forms the real foundation of morals; that
we do not immediately approve or disapprove of any given action,
when we have become acquainted with the intention of the agent and
the consequences of what he has done, but that we previously enter,
by means of that sympathetic affection which is natural to us, into the
feelings of the agent, and those to whom the action relates; that
having considered all the motives and passions by which the agent
was actuated, we pronounce, with respect to the <em>propriety</em> or <em>impropriety</em>
of the action, according as we sympathise or not with him;
while we pronounce, with respect to the <em>merit</em> or <em>demerit</em> of the action,
according as we sympathise with the gratitude or resentment of those
who were its objects; and that we necessarily judge of our own conduct
by comparing it with such maxims and rules as we have deduced
from observations previously made on the conduct of others.â This
theory, ingenious as it is, is generally abandoned as untenable. Dr.
Brown has argued, and the objection seems fatal, that though sympathy
may diffuse, it cannot originate moral sentiments: at the same
time he bears the strongest testimony to the literary merits and moral
tendency of the work.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1763 Smith received from the University of Glasgow the honorary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>degree of Doctor of Laws, and he was offered, and accepted, the
situation of travelling tutor to the young Duke of Buccleugh. His
long residence in the populous and manufacturing metropolis of western
Scotland had enabled him to collect a rich hoard of materials for the
great work he had in view; and this new appointment changed the
method, rather than interrupted the course, of his studies. It afforded
him the means of examining the habits, institutions, and condition of
man under new forms, and in new countries, and he observed with
his natural acuteness and sagacity the influence of locality, of climate,
and of government. He no doubt derived considerable advantage
from the society of the distinguished men with whom he associated
at Paris; among these, Turgot, DâAlembert, Helvetius, Marmontel,
Morellet, Rochefoucauld, and Quesnay, were his intimate friends.
So highly did he appreciate the talents of the last-named person as
an economist, that he had intended, had Quesnay lived, to have acknowledged
the debt he owed him by dedicating to him his own great
work on the âWealth of Nations.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Having spent two years on the Continent, Dr. Smith returned to
England with his pupil, and soon after joined his mother at Kirkaldy,
where he resided for about ten years almost entirely in seclusion,
occupied in the prosecution of his great work. It was published in
1776; and few books have ever been given to the world tending
more directly to destroy the prejudices, develop the powers, and promote
the happiness of mankind. But the world at that time was not
clear-sighted enough to appreciate its merits. Dr. Smith however
had the gratification to see that, during fifteen years which elapsed
between its publication and his death, it had produced a considerable
effect upon public opinion, and that the eyes of men were beginning
to be opened upon an object of such importance to human happiness.
In this country at least Dr. Smith was the creator of the science of
political economy, for he had only a chaos of materials from which
to form it. Some defects may be discovered in his arrangement,
and some errors detected in the principles as laid down by him; for
it is hardly given to human intellect, that the originator of a science
should also carry it to perfection. But Smith established the foundation
upon which all future superstructures must rest; and the labours
of Ricardo, Malthus, and some now living, eminent as they are,
instead of superseding their predecessor do but enhance his merit.
With all the progress which liberty of every kind has made since his
time, no one has maintained the freedom of industry in all its bearings
more forcibly than himself. The theories of rent, and of population,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>seem to be the only important branches of the science, as it now
stands, which had escaped his observation.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1778 Dr. Smith was appointed Commissioner of the Customs for
Scotland. The duties of his office obliged him to quit London, where
he had resided for two years subsequent to the publication of the
âWealth of Nations,â and where his society had been courted by the
most distinguished characters; and he took up his abode in Edinburgh,
accompanied by his aged mother. In 1787 he was elected Rector of
the University of Glasgow; a compliment which gave him great
pleasure, as he was much attached to that body, and grateful for the
services it had rendered him in his youth, and the honours it had conferred
on him at a more advanced age.</p>

<p class='c000'>His mother died in 1784, and his grief on this occasion is supposed
to have injured his health, and his constitution, which had never been
robust, began to give way. He suffered another severe privation in
the death of his cousin, Miss Douglas, who had managed his household
for many years, since the infirmities of his parent had disqualified
her for that employment. He survived Miss Douglas only two years,
and died in 1790 of a tedious and painful illness, which he bore with
patience and resignation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Adam Smithâs private character is thus summed up by his friend
Mr. Dugald Stewart: âThe more delicate and characteristical features
of his mind it is perhaps impossible to trace. That there were many
peculiarities both in his manners and in his intellectual habits was
manifest to the most superficial observer; but, although to those who
knew him, these peculiarities detracted nothing from the respect which
his abilities commanded; and although, to his intimate friends, they
added an inexpressible charm to his conversation, while they displayed
in the most interesting light the artless simplicity of his heart, yet it
would require a very skilful pencil to present them to the public eye.
He was certainly not fitted for the general commerce of the world, or
for the business of active life. The comprehensive speculations with
which he had been occupied from his youth, and the variety of materials
which his own inventions continually supplied to his thoughts,
rendered him habitually inattentive to familiar objects and to common
occurrences; and he frequently exhibited instances of absence which
had scarcely been surpassed by the fancy of La BruyÃ¨re. Even in
company he was apt to be engrossed with his studies, and appeared,
at times, by the motion of his lips, as well as by his looks and gestures,
to be in the fervour of composition. I have often however
been struck, at the distance of years, with his accurate memory of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>most trifling particulars; and am inclined to believe, from this and
some other circumstances, that he possessed a power, not perhaps uncommon
among absent men, of recollecting, in consequence of subsequent
efforts of reflection, many occurrences which, at the time when
they happened, did not seem to have sensibly attracted his notice.</p>

<p class='c000'>âTo the defect now mentioned, it was probably owing, in part, that
he did not fall in easily with the common dialogue of conversation,
and that he was somewhat apt to convey his own ideas in the form of
a lecture. When he did so however, it never proceeded from a wish
to engross the discourse, or gratify his vanity. His own inclination
disposed him so strongly to enjoy in silence the gaiety of those around
him, that his friends were often led to concert little schemes, in order
to engage him in the discussions most likely to interest him. Nor do
I think I shall be accused of going too far, when I say that he was
scarcely ever known to start a new topic himself, or to appear unprepared
upon those topics that were introduced by others. Indeed, his
conversation was never more amusing than when he gave a loose to
his genius, upon the very few branches of knowledge of which he
only possessed the outlines.</p>

<p class='c000'>âIn his external form and appearance there was nothing uncommon.
When perfectly at ease, and when warmed with conversation, his gestures
were animated, and not ungraceful; and in the society of those
he loved, his features were often brightened with a smile of inexpressible
benignity.... He never sat for his picture, but the
medallion by Tassie conveys an exact idea of his profile, and of the
general expression of his countenance.â It is from this that our
portrait of him is engraved.</p>

<p class='c000'>To those of Smithâs works of which we have already spoken, we
have to add two articles in a short-lived periodical publication, called
the âEdinburgh Review,â for 1755, containing a review of Johnsonâs
Dictionary, and a letter on the state of literature in the different
countries of Europe; an âEssay on the Formation of Languages;â and
Essays, published after his death by his desire, with an account of his
life and writings prefixed, by Dugald Stewart, on the Principles which
lead and direct Philosophical Inquiries; on the nature of the Imitation
practised in the Imitative Arts; on the affinity between certain English
and Italian verses; and on the External Senses. To that account of
his life we may refer for an able analysis of his most important
writings, as well as to the memoir prefixed to Mr. Maccullochâs
edition of the âWealth of Nations,â from which this sketch is principally
taken.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CALVIN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>John Cauvin (afterwards called Calvin) was born of humble parents,
his father following the trade of a cooper, at Noyon in Picardy, July 10,
1509. He was intended in the first instance for the profession of the
church, and two benefices were already set apart for him, when, at a
very early age, from what motive is not exactly known, his destination
was suddenly changed, and he was sent, first to Orleans and then to
Bourges, to learn under distinguished teachers the science of jurisprudence.
He is said to have made great proficiency in that study;
but nevertheless, he found leisure to cultivate other talents, and made
himself acquainted with Greek, Hebrew, and Syriac, during his residence
at Bourges. His natural inclination seems ever to have bent
him towards those pursuits to which his earliest attention was directed;
and though he never attended the schools of theology, nor had at any
time any public master in that science, yet his thoughts were never
far away from it; and the time which he could spare from his professional
labours was employed on subjects bearing more or less
directly upon religion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus it was, that he failed not to take part in the discussions, which
arose in France during his early years, respecting the principles of the
Reformation; and it may be, that his happy escape from theological
tuition made him more disposed to embrace them. It is certain
that his opposition to the Church of Rome became very soon notorious,
and made him, young as he was, an object of jealousy to some of its
powerful adherents. Even the moderate Erasmus viewed his aspiring
talents and determined character with some undefined apprehension;
and he is related (after a conversation with Calvin at Strasbourg) to
have remarked to Bucer, who had presented him,ââI see in that
young man the seeds of a dangerous pest, which will some day throw
great disorder into the Church.â The weak and wavering character
of Erasmus renders it difficult for us to understand what sort of disorder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>it was that he anticipated, or what exactly was the <em>Church</em> on
which the apprehended mischief was to fall. In 1535 Calvin
published his great work, the âChristian Institute,â which was intended
as a sort of confession of faith of the French reformers, in answer to
the calumnies which confounded them with the frantic Anabaptists of
Germany.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1536, finding that his person was no longer secure in France,
Calvin determined to retire into Germany, and was compelled by
accident to pass through Geneva. He found this city in a state of
extreme confusion. The civil government was popular, and in those
days tumultuous: the ecclesiastical had been entirely dissolved by the
departure of the bishops and clergy on the triumph of the Reformation,
and only such laws existed as the individual influence of the pastors
was able to impose upon their several flocks. It was a tempting field
for spiritual ambition, and Calvin was readily persuaded to enter into
it. He decided to remain at Geneva, and forthwith opened a theological
school.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the very year following his arrival, he formed the design of
introducing into his adopted country a regular system of ecclesiastical
polity. He assembled the people; and, not without much opposition,
prevailed on them at length to bind themselves by oath; <em>first</em>, that
they would not again, on any consideration, ever submit to the dominion
of Rome; <em>secondly</em>, that they would render obedience to a
certain code of ecclesiastical laws, which he and his colleagues had
drawn up for them. Some writers do not expressly mention that this
second proposition was accepted by the peopleâif accepted, it was
immediately violated: and as Calvin and his clerical coadjutors (who
were only two in number) refused with firmness to administer the
holy communion to such as rejected the condition, the people, not yet
prepared to endure that bondage, banished the spiritual legislators
from the city, in April, 1538.</p>

<p class='c000'>Calvin retired to Strasbourg, where he renewed his intimacy with
Bucer, and became more and more distinguished for his talents and
learning. He was present at the Conferences of Worms and Ratisbon,
where he gained additional reputation. He founded a French reformed
church at Strasbourg, and obtained a theological chair in that city; at
the same time, he continued in communication with Geneva, and in
expressions of unabated affection for his former adherents. Meanwhile,
the disorders which had prevailed in that city were in no manner alleviated
by his exile, and a strong reaction gradually took place in his
favour; insomuch, that, in the year 1541, there being a vacancy in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>the ministry, the senate and the assembly of the people proclaimed
with equal vehemence their wish for the return of Calvin. âWe will
have Calvin, that good and learned man, Christâs minister.â âThis,â
says Calvin, Epist. 24, âwhen I understood, I could not choose but
praise God; nor was I able to judge otherwise, than that this was the
Lordâs doing; and that it was marvellous in our eyes; and that the
stone which the builders refused was now made the head of the
corner.â</p>

<p class='c000'>It was on September 13th that he returned from his exile in the pride
of spiritual triumph; and he began, without any loss of time, while
the feelings of all classes were yet warm in his favour, to establish
that rigid form of ecclesiastical discipline which he may formerly have
meditated, but which he did not fully propound till now. He proposed
to institute a standing court (the Consistory), consisting of all
the ministers of religion, who were to be perpetual members, and also
of twice the same number of laymen to be chosen annually. To these
he committed the charge of public morality, with power to determine
all kinds of ecclesiastical causes; with authority to convene, control,
and punish, even with excommunication, whomsoever they might think
deserving. It was in vain that many advanced objections to this
scheme: that they urged the despotic character of this court; the certainty
too, that the perpetual judges, though fewer in number, would
in fact predominate over a majority annually elected; and that Calvin,
through his power over the clergy, would be master of the decisions
of the whole tribunal. He persisted inflexibly; and since there now
remained with the people of Geneva only the choice of receiving his
laws or sending him once more into exile, they acquiesced reluctantly
in the former determination. On the 20th of November, in the same
year (1541), the Presbytery was established at Geneva.</p>

<p class='c000'>Maimbourg, in his âHistory of Calvinism,â has remarked that,
from this time forward, Calvin became, not pontiff only, but also
caliph, of Geneva; since the unbounded influence which he possessed
in the Consistory extended to the council, and no important state-affair
was transacted without his advice or approbation. At the same time,
he enlarged the limits of his spiritual power, and made it felt in every
quarter of Europe. In France most especially he was regarded personally
as the head of the Reformed Church; he composed a liturgy
for its use; and, secured from persecution by his residence and dignity,
he gave laws, by his writings and his emissaries, to the scattered
congregations of Reformers. The fruits of his unwearied industry
were everywhere in their hands. His Institute, and his learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Expositions of Scripture, were substantial foundations of spiritual
authority; and he became to his Church what the âMaster of the
Sentences,ââalmost what Augustin himselfâhad been to the Church
of Rome. And he did the Reformed Church an essential service
by procuring the establishment of the academy, or university of
Geneva; which was long the principal nursery of Presbyterian
ministers, and which was the chief instrument of communicating to
the citizens of its little state, that general mental culture and love
of literature for which they have been remarkable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The peculiarities of his religious opinions are known to all our
readers; nor indeed, at any rate, have we space, in this brief outline
of the Life of the Reformer, so to detail his tenets as to avoid the
chance of misconception, either by his followers or his adversaries.
We shall, therefore, proceed to another subject, respecting which
there will be little difference, either as to the facts themselves, or the
judgment to be formed of themâwe mean that darkest act of his
life, which being, as far as we learn, unatoned and unrepented, throws
so deep a shadow over all the rest, as almost to make us question his
sincerity in any good principle, or his capability of any righteous
purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Spaniard, named Servetus, born at Villa Nueva, in Aragon, in
the same year with Calvin, had been long engaged in a correspondence
with the latter, which had finally degenerated into angry and abusive
controversy. He had been educated as a physician, and had acquired
great credit in his profession; when, in an evil hour, he entered the
field of theological controversy, and professed without fear, and defended
without modification, the Unitarian doctrine; adding to it
some obscure and fanciful notions, peculiar, we believe, to his own
imagination. He published very early in life âSeven Books concerning
the Errors of the Trinity,â and he continued in the same principles
until the year 1553, when he put forth (at Vienne, in DauphinÃ©), a
work entitled âThe Restoration of Christianity, &amp;c.,â in further confirmation
of his views.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now it is very true, that the propagation of these opinions by a professed
Reformer was at that crisis a matter of great scandal, and
perhaps even of some danger to the cause of the Reformation. It
was felt as such by some of the leading Reformers. Zuinglius and
Åcolampadius eagerly disclaimed the error of Servetus. âOur
Church will be very ill spoken of,â said the latter in a letter to Bucer,
âunless our divines make it their business to cry him down.â And
had they been contented to proclaim their dissent from his doctrine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>or to assail it by reasonable argument, they would have done no more
than their duty to their own communion absolutely demanded of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Calvin was not a man who would argue where he could command,
or persuade where he could overthrow. Full of vehemence and
bitterness, inflexible and relentless, he was prepared to adopt and to
justify extreme measures, wheresoever they answered his purpose
best. He was animated by the pride, intolerance, and cruelty of the
Church of Rome, and he planted and nourished those evil passions in
his little Consistory at Geneva.</p>

<p class='c000'>Servetus, having escaped from confinement at Vienne, and flying
for refuge to Naples, was driven by evil destiny, or his own infatuation,
to Geneva. Here he strove to conceal himself, till he should be
enabled to proceed on his journey; but he was quickly discovered by
Calvin, and immediately cast into prison. This was in the summer
of 1553. Presently followed the formality of his trial; and when we
read the numerous articles of impeachment, and observe the language
in which they are couched;âwhen we peruse the humble petitions
which he addressed to the âSyndics and Council,â praying only that
an advocate might be granted him, which prayer was haughtily refused;âwhen
we perceive the misrepresentations of his doctrine, and
the offensive terms of his condemnation, we appear to be carried back
again to the Halls of Constance, and to be witnessing the fall of Huss
and Jerome beneath their Roman Catholic oppressors. So true it is
(as Grotius had sufficient reason to say), âthat the Spirit of Antichrist
did appear at Geneva as well as at Rome.â</p>

<p class='c000'>But the magistrates of this Republic did not venture completely
to execute the will of Calvin, without first consulting the other
Protestant cities of Switzerland; namely, Zurich, Berne, BÃ¢sle, and
Schaffhausen. The answers returned by these all indicated very great
anxiety for the extinction of the heresy, without however expressly
demanding the blood of the heretic. The people of Zurich were the
most violent: and the answer of their âPastors, Readers, and Ministers,â
which is praised and preserved by Calvin, is worthy of the
communion from which they had so lately seceded. As soon as these
communications reached Geneva, Servetus was immediately condemned
to death (on the 26th of October, 1553), and was executed on
the day following.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is extant a letter written by Calvin to his friend and brother-minister,
William Farel (dated the 26th), which announces that the
fatal sentence had been passed, and would be executed on the morrow.
It is only remarkable for the cold conciseness and heartless indifference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>of its expressions. Not a single word indicates any feeling of
compassion or repugnance. And as the work of persecution was carried
on without mercy, and completed without pity, so likewise was it
recollected without remorse; and the Protestant Republican Minister
of Christ continued for some years afterwards to insult with abusive
epithets the memory of his victim.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after the death of Servetus, Calvin published a vindication of
his proceedings, in which he defended, without any compromise, the
principle on which he had acted. It is entitled, âA Faithful Exposition
and short Refutation of the Errors of Servetus, wherein it is
shown that heretics should be restrained by the power of the sword.â
His friend and biographer Beza also put forth a work âOn the propriety
of punishing Heretics by the Civil authority.â Thus Calvin
not only indulged his own malevolent humour, but also sought to
establish among the avowed principles of his own Church the duty of
exterminating all who might happen to differ from it.</p>

<p class='c000'>He lived eleven years longer; and expired at Geneva on the 27th
of May, 1564; having maintained his authority to the end of his life,
without acquiring any of the affection of those about him. Neither of
these circumstances need surprise us, for it was his character to awe,
to command, and to repel. Fearless, inflexible, morose, and imperious;
he neither courted any one, nor yielded to any one, nor conciliated any
one. Yet he was sensible of, and seemingly contrite for, his defects of
temper; for he writes to Bucer: âI have not had harder contests
with my vices, which are great and many, than with my impatience.
I have not yet been able to subdue that savage brute.â His talents
were extremely powerful, both for literature and for business. His
profound and various learning acquired for him the general respect
which it deserved. He was active and indefatigable; he slept little,
and was remarkable for his abstemious habits. With a heart inflated
and embittered with spiritual pride, he affected a perfect
simplicity of manner; and professed, and may indeed have felt, a consummate
contempt for the ordinary objects of human ambition. Besides
this, he was far removed from the besetting vice of common minds, by
which even noble qualities are so frequently degradedâavarice. He
neither loved money for itself, nor grasped at it for its uses; and at
his death, the whole amount of his property, including his library,
did not exceed, at the lowest statement, one hundred and twenty-five
crowns, at the highest, three hundred.</p>

<p class='c000'>We may thus readily understand how it was that Calvin acquired,
through the mere force of personal character thrown into favourable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>circumstances, power almost uncontrolled over a state of which he
was not so much as a native, and considerable influence besides over
the spiritual condition of Europeâpower and influence, of which deep
traces still exist both in the country which adopted him, and in others
where he was only known by his writings and his doctrines. His
doctrines still divide the Christian world; but that ecclesiastical principle,
which called in the authority of the sword for their defence, has
been long and indignantly disclaimed by all his followers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The best clue to the real character of Calvin will be found in his
letters. Many accounts of his life, as well as of his doctrines and
writings, exist; but they are mostly influenced by party feeling. The
earliest is that of his friend Beza; it is said however not to be strictly
accurate even as to the facts of Calvinâs life before 1549, when the
author became acquainted with him, and it is of course a panegyric.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The first Earl of Mansfield was a younger son of a noble house in
Scotland, which he raised to higher rank by his own brilliant talents
and successful industry.</p>

<p class='c000'>William Murray was the eleventh child of David, Viscount Stormont,
and was born at Perth, March 2, 1704. He received his
education at Westminster School and Christchurch College, Oxford,
where he gained distinction by the elegance of his scholarship. He
took his degree of M.A. in June, 1730, and was called to the bar in
the Michaelmas term following: the interval he employed in travelling
in France and Italy. At an early age he gained the friendship of
Pope, who in several passages has borne testimony to the grace,
eloquence, rising fame, and attractive social accomplishments of the
young lawyer. In 1737, in consequence of the sudden illness of his
leader, who was seized with a fit in court, Mr. Murray had to undertake,
at an hourâs notice, the duty of senior counsel, in the cause of
Cibber <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">v.</span></i> Sloper. From his success on this occasion he was wont to
date the origin of his fortune. âBusiness,â he said, âpoured in
upon me on all sides; and from a few hundred pounds a year I
fortunately found myself, in every subsequent year, in possession of
thousands.â In the same year he was retained by the corporation
of Edinburgh in the memorable transactions which arose out of the
Porteous riot; and his exertions to preserve their privileges were
subsequently acknowledged by the gift of the freedom of the city
in a gold box. November 20, 1738, Mr. Murray was married to
Lady Elizabeth Finch, daughter of the Earl of Winchelsea, a lady
who, in addition to rank and fortune, possessed those more valuable
qualities which rendered their married life, through near half a century,
one of harmony and domestic happiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Murray was appointed Solicitor-General in 1742, and took his
seat in parliament, for the first time, as member for Boroughbridge.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>For many years, during which he held office under the Pelham
administration, he was recognized in the House of Commons as one
of the ablest supporters of government; and he was frequently opposed
in the outset of his career to Mr. Pitt, who, after the elevation
of both to the upper house, bore this high testimony, among others,
to Murrayâs weight as a speaker. âNo man is better acquainted with
his abilities and learning, nor has a greater respect for them, than I
have. I have had the pleasure of sitting with him in the other house,
and always listened to him with attention. I have not lost a word of
what he said, nor did I ever.â In his official station, he necessarily
took a prominent part in the prosecution of the rebel lords, especially
at the trial of Lord Lovat in 1747; and his eloquence was set off
by his fairness towards the prisoner, whose concern in the rebellion
was indeed too evident to admit of hesitation on the part of his
judges. We may follow up the history of his legal advancement by
briefly stating that, in 1754, he was appointed Attorney-General, and,
in 1756, Chief Justice of the Kingâs Bench, and, at the same time,
raised to the peerage, by the title of Baron Mansfield. It is said that
the Duke of Newcastle was extremely unwilling to consent to the
removal of his most powerful supporter from the Commons, but was
forced to comply by the threat that, if he refused, Murray would no
longer act as Attorney-General.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Mansfieldâs private life appears for the most part to have been
passed in tranquil prosperity, which afforded no incidents for the biographer
to dwell on; at least the published records of him are nearly
confined to his exertions as an advocate, his speeches in parliament,
and reports on the important cases which he adjudicated. It will be
sufficient here to mention those events by which Lord Mansfield is
connected with the public history of England, and to make a few
general observations on his character as a lawyer and a judge.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1763, the legality of what were called general warrants, not
directed against persons by name specifically, but generally against
any person or persons supposed to be guilty of a certain act, was
mooted, in consequence of a secretary of stateâs warrant to apprehend
the âauthors, printers and publishersâ of the celebrated No. 45 of
the âNorth Briton.â Wilkes, being apprehended by virtue of this
warrant, was discharged by Pratt, afterwards Lord Camden, Chief
Justice of the Common Pleas, when brought up before that court by
writ of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i>. The question came before Lord Mansfield in
a different form. An action of trespass was brought in the court of
Common Pleas against the messengers who executed the warrant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>and a verdict was given for the plaintiff. A bill of exceptions against
Chief Justice Prattâs directions to the jury was tendered, in pursuance
of which the question was again argued before Lord Mansfield, who
coincided with his brother chief in holding the instrument illegal
under which the defendants had acted. Since this decision, general
warrants have been disused.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1768, Wilkes, then at the height of his popularity, returned to
England, and applied for a reversal of his outlawry. The excitement
of his partisans broke out both in riots and in indecent attempts to
intimidate the judges before whom the point was to be argued. Lord
Mansfield pronounced for the reversal upon the ground of a technical
informality, which the Court held fatal to the process; but in his
elaborate judgment he took care strongly to censure the seditious
efforts which had been made to influence the court, and to impress on
his auditors that the apparently trifling objection on which the judgment
turned was fatal in law, and could not have been passed over in
any other case. This speech has been much admired; nor is it easy
to overrate its beauties as a composition: it lies open, however, to the
objection of being too theatrical. After overruling the objections
made by the defendantâs counsel, it rises into eloquent declamation
against the attacks of the press, and the threats of the mob; and, at
the moment when all seems ripe for a contrary decision, proceeds to
grant the thing so loudly clamoured for. He may safely contemn
danger who does not expose himself to it; and it would on this occasion
have been more dignified to make less parade of independence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Mansfieldâs view of the law of libel exposed him to much
obloquy. He was a resolute assertor of the doctrine that juries were
to judge of the fact only, not of the law, or rather of the question,
libel or no libel. A prerogative lawyer on the bench, he was a supporter
of Tory principles in parliament. He strenuously maintained
the right of the British legislature to tax America, and was the advocate,
though he probably would not have been the adviser, of those
measures which led to the American revolution; for the temper of
his mind seems to have been cautious and somewhat timid, and his
political conduct was swayed by an habitual moderation, which sometimes
prevented his accession to the more violent measures of his
party. His course was consistent with what we may suppose to have
been his early prejudices, for he came of a Jacobite family; and it
was made a matter of accusation against him, while Attorney-General
(most unfairly revived by Junius), that, as a schoolboy, he had been
known to drink Jacobite toasts. The charge, if true, was too trivial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>to merit further notice than George II. bestowed upon it: âWhatever
they were while they were Westminster boys, they are now my
very good friends.â At the same time he was a steady advocate of
religious toleration, both on the bench and in the House of Lords.
This he showed in 1768, on occasion of the prosecution of a Roman
Catholic priest by a common informer, in his strict dealing with the
penal laws enacted against that class of men; and in assigning his
reasons for admitting a Quakerâs evidence on affirmation in certain
cases. And the Dissenters in general, and especially of the city of
London, were much indebted to his support in the House of Lords
in 1767, for the abolition of that mean and oppressive custom by
which they were fined for refusing to serve the office of sheriff, being
at the same time subject to legal penalties if they accepted it. Lord
Mansfieldâs exposition of the iniquity of this practice was unsparing
and conclusive.</p>

<p class='c000'>The unprecedentedly-long period during which Lord Mansfield
presided in the Kingâs Bench is one of considerable importance in the
history of British jurisprudence; indeed, the multiplicity of his decisions
during a period of thirty-four years could not fail materially to
affect the law relating both to commercial and other property, especially
in a country so rapidly increasing in wealth, and in which new cases
were continually arising out of the ever-changing state of society.
By a large body of his admirers, a class including the majority of
the nation, he was regarded with almost unlimited admiration; but
several of his important judgments have since been overruled; and
we probably shall not err in stating it as the general opinion of well-informed
persons in the present day, that, indecent and virulent as is
Juniusâs attack on him as a judge, there is a solid foundation for the
charge that he was more prone to enlarge the power of the crown
than to protect the liberty of the subject, and more willingly referred
to the Roman law and the law of nations than to Magna Charta and
the Bill of Rights. But the charge of introducing equitable doctrines
into the common law must be received with much more caution. He
may have gone too far in his favourite scheme of introducing more
enlarged and liberal views than had prevailed before his time; he
may have neglected former authorities, and introduced too great laxity
in the interpretation of the law; but, dangerous as such licence is,
lest, in the uncertainty of law, a greater evil be incurred than by the
occasional commission of an essential injustice, yet we must look with
complacency on that alleged tendency to relax the strict rigour of law
in favour of substantial justice, which seems to have consisted chiefly
in a disposition to admit evidence when mere technical disqualification,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>and not essential unfitness, was urged against it; and rather
to let right prevail than give the victory to wrong by rigid adherence
to the technicalities of the law. His feelings may be illustrated by a
playful saying of his own to Garrick. âA judge on the bench is now
and then in your whimsical situation between Tragedy and Comedy;
inclination drawing one way, and a long string of precedents the
other.â It is certain that to him we owe all that our mercantile law
has of system, and of consistency with the principles which govern
the practice of other nations. It is no less true that the remedies
generally afforded by our courts of law have become much more
beneficial, since he enlarged and moulded actions originally of an
equitable nature to suit cases to which proceedings in equity are
very ill adapted. Nor is it too much to assert that under him the
science of law assumed the form of a liberal study.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is hardly necessary to reply to the graver charges of moral guilt
adduced by the able and unscrupulous author to whom we have referred.
The spirit in which they are conceived may be estimated
from the unmeasured vituperation of the Scotch in general, which
forms the opening of the forty-first letter of Junius, addressed to Lord
Mansfield. His lordshipâs knowledge of English law has been impugned;
his innovations upon its doctrines have been censured; his
application and extension of its principles have been questioned; and
his constitutional doctrines have been often and justly condemned;
but we do not believe that his honesty has been seriously doubted,
since the violence of party animosity has ceased to inflame menâs
passions and pervert their judgment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our knowledge of Lord Mansfieldâs private history is very limited.
His life however seems to have been spent in happiness and tranquillity,
until the riots of 1780, in which his house, with its contents,
was destroyed. Beside a valuable property in books, pictures, and
furniture, he sustained that loss which, to a literary man, is irreparable,âthe
collected manuscripts of a laborious life. He bore this
heavy calamity with honourable fortitude, and declined to accept of
pecuniary compensation. To the application of government he returned
this answer: âI think it does not become me to claim or
expect reparation from the state. I have made up my mind to my
misfortune as I ought, with this consolation, that it came from those
whose object manifestly was general confusion and destruction at
home, in addition to a dangerous and complicated war abroad. If I
should lay before you any account or computation of the pecuniary
damage I have sustained, it might seem a claim or expectation of
being indemnified.â Shortly afterwards he appeared in the House
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>of Lords, to justify the strong measures by which the riots had been
quelled. âIt was wonderful,â says Bishop Newton in his âLife and
Anecdotes,â âafter such a shock as he had received, that he could so
soon summon his faculties as to make one of the finest and ablest
speeches that ever was heard in parliament, to justify the legality of
the late proceedings on the part of government, to demonstrate that
no royal prerogative had been exerted, no martial law had been exercised,
nothing had been done but what every man, civil or military,
had a right to do in the like cases. âI speak not from books,â he
said, âfor books I have none;â having been all consumed in the fire.
The effects of his speech were the admiration and conviction of all
who heard him, and put an end to the debate without division. Lord
Mansfield never appeared greater in any action of his life.â No particular
cause connected with the frenzy of the time can be assigned
for this attack on the Chief Justice; he had not been active in supporting
the measures for the relief of the Catholics, which produced
this remarkable ebullition of folly and wickedness. But when once
riot is afoot, the causes which have first stirred up menâs minds are
readily forgotten; and the violence of party abuse with which Lord
Mansfield had been assailed, and the unpopularity of the government,
in which he was supposed to exercise a principal though secret influence,
are sufficient to account for this calamity.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1776, Lord Mansfield, at his own request, was raised to the
dignity of an earl. He had no children, and his object was to raise
the rank of his paternal family in the person of his nephew Lord
Stormont, to whom the succession was secured. In 1784, he was
compelled to absent himself from his judicial duties for a season, and
spent some time, with considerable benefit to his health, at Tunbridge
Wells. He returned to his judicial employment and continued to
exercise it with unclouded intellect, being only prevented by bodily
infirmity from attending the court during the last year and a half that
he held the office. In 1788 he resigned it, at the advanced age of
eighty-four, having presided in the court of Kingâs Bench for the
unprecedented period of thirty-two years, and being still in possession
of a share of health and power of enjoyment which seldom fall to
the lot of so advanced an age. He retained the perfect possession
of his faculties until within a week of his death, which took place
March 18, 1794, in the ninetieth year of his age.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of this, as of many other eminent men, we may regret
that so few particulars of their every-day manners have been preserved.
In the relations of private life his conduct was exemplary; and the
amenity of his manners, the playfulness of his wit, and his admirable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>qualifications as a companion, secured the affection of those who enjoyed
his society. His talents as a speaker were set off by a graceful
and attractive person, and a remarkably harmonious voice; qualifications
greatly conducing to good delivery, which it is said he was
in the habit of improving in youth, by sedulous cultivation under the
direction of Pope.</p>

<p class='c000'>A gentleman (Mr. Baillie), who had been deeply indebted to Lord
Mansfieldâs professional abilities, bequeathed 1500<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> to erect a monument
to his memory. The commission was entrusted to worthy hands,
for it was given to Flaxman. A sketch of his work forms the vignette
to this memoir.</p>

<p class='c000'>The âLife of the Earl of Mansfield,â by Mr. Halliday, is the only
biographical account of this eminent lawyer which we know to exist.
It is too manifestly panegyrical, and, as has been intimated, contains
a very meagre account of the private history of its noble subject. It
is mainly occupied by reports of Lord Mansfieldâs speeches and judgments,
and must therefore be chiefly acceptable to legal readers.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>BRADLEY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Of all men who have combined both astronomical theory and practice,
Bradley is one of the most remarkable. In this respect, we must
assign to him the first place in English history; and if we were disposed
to add, in that of the world, we are convinced that no country
would pretend to offer more than one candidate to dispute his claim.</p>

<p class='c000'>James Bradley<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> was born in March 1692â3, at Sherbourn in Gloucestershire.
He was educated at the Grammar School of Northleach,
and admitted of Baliol College, Oxford, in March 1710â11, where he
proceeded to the degrees of B.A. and M.A. in the years 1714 and 1717
respectively. His motherâs brother was James Pound (deceased 1724),
rector of Wanstead in Essex, and known as an observer, particularly
by the observations which he furnished to Newton, as described in the
Principia. With him Bradley spent much of his younger life, and
was his assistant in his astronomical pursuits; and some observations
of 1718â19 on double stars are in good accordance with the relative
motions which have been since established in the case of those bodies.
His tables of Jupiterâs satellites, on which he was employed at the
same time, show that he had detected the greater part of the inequalities
in their motions which have since been observed.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The facts here given are entirely taken from the searching account of Bradley
given by Professor Rigaud in his âMiscellaneous Works, &amp;c., of James Bradley,
Oxford, 1832.â</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In 1718 he was elected fellow of the Royal Society; in 1719 he
was ordained to the vicarage of Bridstow, in Monmouthshire; in the
following year he received a sinecure preferment. But in 1721 he
resigned these livings, on obtaining the Savilian professorship of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Astronomy at Oxford, the holder of which, by the statutes, must not
have any benefice. To finish what we may call the gazette of his
life, he was engaged in observation (with what results we shall presently
see) both at Kew and Wanstead till 1732, when he went to
reside at Oxford, having since 1729 given yearly courses of lectures
on Experimental Philosophy. In 1742 he was appointed to succeed
Halley as Astronomer Royal, and he held this appointment for the
remainder of his life. In the same year he obtained the degree of
D.D. In 1752, having refused the living of Greenwich, because he
thought the duty of a pastor to be incompatible with his other studies
and necessary engagements, he was presented with a pension of 250<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i>
The last observation made by him in the observatory is dated Sept. 1,
1761; and he died July 13, 1762, at Chalford in Gloucestershire,
having been afflicted by various diseases for several years, and particularly
by a depression of spirits, arising from the fear lest he should
survive his faculties. He married in 1744, and left one daughter,
who died at Greenwich in 1812.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are now no lineal descendants of Bradley. Most of his
writings, which were few in number, were published in the Philosophical
Transactions. His personal merits are proved by the number
of his friends, and the warmth with which they endeavoured to serve
him when occasion arose, as well as by the strength of the testimonies
which those who survived bore to his reputation as a man and a
member of society.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have much abridged the preceding account, in order to make
room for a popular exposition of his two great discoveriesâthe <em>aberration
of light</em>, and the <em>nutation of the earthâs axis</em>. If we were to blot
these discoveries out of his life, there would remain an ample stock of
useful labours, fully sufficient to justify us in stating that Bradley was
unequalled as an observer, and of no mean character as a philosopher.
But for the latter we must refer the reader to the excellent account
from which our facts have been taken, or to any history of astronomy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>parallax</em> of the fixed stars had been long a subject of inquiry.
If a body describe a circle, and a spectator on that body be unconscious
of his own motion, all other bodies will appear to describe
circles parallel to that of the spectatorâs motion, and, absolutely speaking,
equal to it; consequently, the greater the distance of the body
from the spectator, the smaller will its apparent annual motion be;
and it will not be circular, because the projection of the circle upon
the apparent sphere of the heavens will foreshorten, and cause it to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>appear oval. If we suppose a star to describe an oval in the course of
a year, the consequence will be that it will pass the spectatorâs meridian
sometimes before a star in the centre of the oval, sometimes after
it; sometimes nearer to the pole of the heavens, and sometimes more
distant; and the nature of the motion of this kind which would arise
from parallax can be mathematically deduced. If the star be so
distant that the oval is too small to be detected by measurement (which
is hitherto the case with the fixed stars), then no alteration of place
will be perceived on this account; but if an oval large enough to be
observed be described in the course of a year, then the test of the
phenomenon arising from the earthâs motion in its orbit is as follows:âImagine
a plane always passing through the centre of the sun, the
centre of the earth, and the centre of the oval described by the star, then
the place of the star in its oval must be in that plane; or draw the shortest
distance on the globe from the centre of the oval to the sun, and
the star will be on the point of the oval which lies in that distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>In and before the time of Bradley, the refraction of light was not
well determined, which would throw a doubt over any observations
made to detect small quantities, unless the star which furnished them
were situated in that part of the observerâs heaven in which there is no
refraction, or next to none, that is, in or near his zenith. For the purpose
of measuring annual parallax, therefore, stars had always been chosen
which passed very nearly over the spot of observation, and instruments
called zenith sectors (now almost out of use) were employed, which
measured small angles of the meridian near the zenith, the latter
point being ascertained by a plumb-line. Mr. Molyneux, a friend
of Bradley, and a wealthy man, had caused the celebrated Graham
to erect a large instrument of this kind at his house in Kew, afterwards
the palace. Bradley and Molyneux observed with this instrument
the star Î³ in the Dragon, which passed nearly through the
zenith of that place, in December 1725. The star was found to
pass the meridian more and more to the south of the zenith, until the
following March, when it was about twenty seconds (about the sixty-five
thousandth part of the whole circuit of the heavens) lower than
at first. It was afterwards traced back again to its first position in
the following December, allowing for the precession of the equinoxes.
Other stars were examined in the same way, and the result was, that
all stars were found to describe small<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> ovals in the course of the year.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>But on comparing the situations of the stars in their small orbits
with the corresponding places of the sun, it was evident that the cause
of the phenomenon could not be the change of place arising from the
orbital motion of the earth. Various hypotheses proposed by Bradley
were found insufficient. In 1727 he erected a zenith sector for himself
at Wanstead; and by further observations, and using different
stars, he came at length to this fact, that instead of the star being in
the place which annual parallax would give it, it was always in the
position which it should have had a quarter of a year later: or that
if the observer could measure the oval with sufficient exactness, and
were to find the time of the year from the star, on the supposition of
annual parallax being the cause of the starâs orbit, he would suppose
himself in March instead of December, and so on.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The original memorandum of Bradley, on the first night on which a decided result
had been obtained, was accidentally found among his papers. There is a fac-simile
of it in Professor Rigaudâs work.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the phenomenon then had a regular connexion with the place
of the earth was evident; but it was not that sort of connexion arising
from the mere change of place of the earth. It is related<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> that he
was led to the true explanation by observing that the vane at the top of
a boatâs mast changed its direction a little whenever the boat was put
about, and made to go in a contrary direction; and that on his remarking
that it was curious the wind should shift every time the boat
was put about, he was assured by the boatmen that the same thing
always happened. Be this as it may, he proposed to the Royal Society,
in 1728, his beautiful explanation of the annual motion which
he had observed in the stars; namely, that it is caused by the alteration
in the apparent direction of the rays of light, arising from the
earth being in motion. Suppose a stream of bullets fired into a
carriage in motion, in a line perpendicular to its side, and so directed
as to hit the middle of the first window, but not with sufficient velocity
to reach any part of the second window. It is plain that they
will strike the hinder pannel, which the motion of the carriage brings
forward, and that to passengers in the inside the direction of the
stream will appear to be from the middle of the window at which
it enters to the opposite hinder pannel: whereas, had the carriage
been at rest, it would have appeared to pass through the centre of
both windows. And to make the stream really pass through both
windows it must, if the carriage be in motion, be directed through the
nearer window towards the foremost pannel on the other side. A ray
of light is in the same situation with regard to the spectator, both as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>to the diurnal and the annual motion of the earth. The former gives
an insensible aberration only; the latter, one which though small is
sensible. The smallness of the latter aberration arises from the velocity
of light being more than ten thousand times that of the earth in
its orbit. And it must be remembered that the motion of light was
not an hypothesis, invented to form the basis of Bradleyâs explanation,
but was ascertained before his time, by RÃ¶mer, from a phenomenon of
an entirely different nature; namely, the retardation observed in the
eclipses of Jupiterâs satellites, as the planet moved from the earth.
The absolute deduction of the laws of aberration was completed by
Bradley.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Professor Rigaud gives this story on the authority of âDr. Thomsonâs History of
the Royal Society,â in which work we find no authority cited for it. We cannot find it
in any other place, but are credibly informed that it rests on good traditional evidence.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The other great discovery of Bradley, namely, the <em>nutation</em>, or
oscillatory motion of the earthâs axis, was completed in 1747. In his
Wanstead observations he had observed some minute discrepancies,
which at that time might be attributed to errors of observation; but
after he was able to clear the apparent place of a star from the effects
of aberration, the field became open to consider and assign the laws of
smaller variations. By continual observation, he found a small irregularity
in the places of the stars, depending upon the position of the
moonâs node. Newton had already shown it to be a consequence of
gravitation, that the sun must produce a small oscillation in the earthâs
axis: Bradley showed that a larger oscillation must arise from the
moon, and be completed in the course of a revolution, not of the
moon, but of the point where her orbit cuts the ecliptic. This discovery
is therefore not of so original a character as the last, since
astronomers had for some time been in the habit of trying to reconcile
every discrepancy which they observed by supposing a nutation; but
to Bradley belongs the merit of discovering that small irregularity
which really can be reconciled to such a supposition, and its physical
causes. The easiest way of conceiving the effect of nutation is
as follows:âThe precession of the equinoxes, discovered by Hipparchus,
has this effect, that the fixed stars, so called, appear to
move round the pole of the ecliptic, at the rate of a revolution in
about 26,000 years. Instead of a star, let a small oval describe the
same course, and let the star in the mean while move round that
oval in the course of nineteen years. The motion thus obtained will
represent the combined effect of precession and nutation.</p>

<p class='c000'>To these discoveries of Bradley we owe, as Delambre observes,
the accuracy of modern astronomy. It must be remarked, that no individual,
whose previous labours have caused public opinion to point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>him out as most fit for the part of Astronomer Royal, has ever been
passed over when occasion occurred, from the time of Flamsteed to
that at which we write. It is the fair reward of such a course, that
the reputation which each successive occupant brought to that position
should be considered as appertaining to him in the public capacity
which it gained for him; and this being granted, it may be
truly said that there is no institution in the world which has, upon
the whole, done so much towards the advancement of correct astronomy
as the Observatory of Greenwich.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>MELANCTHON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Philip was the son of a respectable engineer named Schwartzerde,
that is, Black-earth, a name which he Grecised at a very early age, as
soon as his literary tastes and talents began to display themselves,âassuming,
in compliance with the suggestion of his distinguished kinsman
Reuchlin or Capnio, and according to the fashion of the age,
the classical synonyme of Melancthon. He was born at Bretten,
a place near Wittemberg, February 16, 1497. He commenced
his studies at Heidelberg in 1509; and after three years was
removed to Tubingen, where he remained till 1518. These circumstances
are in this instance not undeserving of notice, because
Melancthon gave from his very boyhood abundant proofs of an
active and brilliant genius, and acquired some juvenile distinctions
which have been recorded by grave historians, and have acquired him
a place among the â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Enfans CÃ©lÃ¨bres</span>â of Baillet. During his residence
at Tubingen he gave public lectures on Virgil, Terence,
Cicero, and Livy, while he was pursuing with equal ardour his
biblical studies; and he had leisure besides to furnish assistance to
Reuchlin in his dangerous contests with the monks, and to direct the
operations of a printing-press. The course of learning and genius,
when neither darkened by early prejudice nor perverted by personal
interests, ever points to liberality and virtue. In the case of Melancthon
this tendency was doubtless confirmed by the near spectacle of
monastic oppression and bigotry; and thus we cannot question that
he had imbibed, even before his departure from Tubingen, the principles
which enlightened his subsequent career, and which throw the
brightest glory upon his memory.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1518 (at the age of twenty-one) he was raised to the Professorship
of Greek in the University of Wittemberg. The moment was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>critical. Luther, who occupied the theological chair in the same
University, had just published his âNinety-five Propositions against
the Abuse of Indulgences,â and was entering step by step into a contest
with the Vatican. He was in possession of great personal authority;
he was older by fourteen years, and was endowed with a far
more commanding spirit, than his brother professor; and thus, in that
intimacy which local circumstances and similarity of sentiments immediately
cemented between these two eminent persons, the ascendancy
was naturally assumed by Luther, and maintained to the end of his
life. Melancthon was scarcely established at Wittemberg when he
addressed to the Reformer some very flattering expressions of admiration,
couched in indifferent Greek iambics; and in the year following
he attended him to the public disputations which he held with
Eckius on the supremacy of the Pope. Here he first beheld the
strife into which he was destined presently to enter, and learned the
distasteful rudiments of theological controversy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two years afterwards, when certain of the opinions of Luther were
violently attacked by the Faculty of Paris, Melancthon interposed to
defend their author, to repel some vain charges which were brought
against him, and to ridicule the pride and ignorance of the doctors of
the Sorbonne. About the same time he engaged in the more delicate
question respecting the celibacy of the clergy, and opposed the Popish
practice with much zeal and learning. This was a subject which he
had always nearest his heart, and, in the discussions to which it led,
he surpassed even Luther in the earnestness of his argument; and he
at least had no personal interest in the decision, as he never took
orders.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1528 it was determined to impose a uniform rule of doctrine
and discipline upon the ministers of the Reformed churches; and the
office of composing it was assigned to Melancthon. He published,
in eighteen chapters, an âInstruction to the Pastors of the Electorate
of Saxony,â in which he made the first formal exposition of the doctrinal
system of the Reformers. The work was promulgated with
the approbation of Luther; and the article concerning the bodily
presence in the Eucharist conveyed the opinion of the master rather
than that of the disciple. Yet were there other points so moderately
treated and set forth in so mild and compromising a temper, as sufficiently
to mark Melancthon as the author of the document; and
so strong was the impression produced upon the Roman Catholics
themselves by its character and spirit, that many considered it the
composition of a disguised friend; and Faber even ventured to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>personal overtures to the composer, and to hold forth the advantages
that he might hope to attain by a seasonable return to the bosom of
the Apostolic Church.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Diet of Augsburg was summoned soon afterwards, and it
assembled in 1530, for the reconciliation of all differences. This
being at least the professed object of both parties, it was desirable that
the conferences should be conducted by men of moderation, disposed
to soften the subjects of dissension, and to mitigate by temper and
manner the bitterness of controversy. For this delicate office Luther
was entirely disqualified, whereas the reputation of Melancthon presented
precisely the qualities that seemed to be required; the management
of the negotiations was accordingly confided to him. But
not without the near superintendence of Luther. The latter was
resident close at hand, he was in perpetual communication with his
disciple, and influenced most of his proceedings; and, at least during
the earlier period of the conferences, he not only suggested the matter,
but even authorised the form, of the official documents.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was thus that the âConfession of Augsbourgâ was composed;
and we observe on its very surface thus much of the spirit of conciliation,
that of its twenty-eight chapters twenty-one were devoted to
the exposition of the opinions of the Reformers, while seven only
were directed against the tenets of their adversaries. In the tedious
and perplexing negotiations that followed, some concessions were privately
proposed by Melancthon, which could scarcely have been
sanctioned by Luther, as they were inconsistent with the principles
of the Reformation and the independence of the Reformers. In some
letters written towards the conclusion of the Diet, he acknowledged
in the strongest terms the authority of the Roman Church, and all its
hierarchy; he asserted that there was positively no doctrinal difference
between the parties; that the whole dispute turned on matters of
discipline and practice; and that, if the Pope would grant only a
provisional toleration on the two points of the double communion and
the marriage of the clergy, it would not be difficult to remove all other
differences, not excepting that respecting the mass. âConcede,â he
says to the Popeâs legate, âor pretend to concede those two points,
and we will submit to the bishops; and if some slight differences shall
still remain between the two parties, they will not occasion any breach
of union, because there is no difference on any point of faith, and they
will be governed by the same bishops; and these bishops, having
once recovered their authority, will be able in process of time to
correct defects which must now of necessity be tolerated.â On this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>occasion Melancthon took counsel of Erasmus rather than of Luther.
It was his object at any rate to prevent the war with which the Protestants
were threatened, and from which he may have expected their
destruction. But the perfect and almost unconditional submission to
the Roman hierarchy, which he proposed as the only alternative,
would have accomplished the same purpose much more certainly;
and Protestant writers have observed, that the bitterest enemy of the
Reformation could have suggested no more effectual or insidious
method of subverting it, than that which was so warmly pressed upon
the Roman Catholics by Melancthon himself. Luther was indignant
when he heard of these proceedings; he strongly urged Melancthon
to break off the negotiations, and to abide by the Confession.
Indeed, it appears that these degrading concessions to avowed enemies
produced, as is ever the case, no other effect than to increase
their pride and exalt their expectations, and so lead them to demand
still more unworthy conditions, and a still more abject humiliation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Howbeit, the reputation of Melancthon was raised by the address
which he displayed during these deliberations; and the variety of
his talents and the extent of his erudition became more generally
known and more candidly acknowledged. The modesty of his character,
the moderation of his temper, the urbanity of his manners, his
flexible and accommodating mind, recommended him to the regard of
all, and especially to the patronage of the great. He was considered
as the peace-maker of the age. All who had any hopes of composing
the existing dissensions and preventing the necessity of absolute schism
placed their trust in the mildness of his expedients. The service
which he had endeavoured to render to the Emperor was sought by
the two other powerful monarchs of that time. Francis I. invited
him to France in 1535, to reconcile the growing differences of his
subjects; and even Henry VIII. expressed a desire for his presence
and his counsels; but the Elector could not be persuaded to consent
to his departure from Saxony.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1541 he held a public disputation with Eckius at Worms, which
lasted three days. The conference was subsequently removed to
Ratisbon, and continued, with pacific professions and polemic arguments,
during the same year, with no other result than an expressed
understanding that both parties should refer their claims to a general
council, and abide by its decision.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meantime, as the Popes showed great reluctance to summon
any such Council, unless it should assemble in Italy and deliberate
under their immediate superintendence, and as the Reformers constantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>refused to submit to so manifest a compromise of their claims,
it seemed likely that some time might elapse before the disputants
should have any opportunity of making their appeal. Wherefore the
emperor, not brooking this delay, and willing by some provisional
measure to introduce immediate harmony between the parties, published
in 1548 a formulary of temporary concord, under the name
of the Interim. It proclaimed the conditions of peace, which were
to be binding only till the decision of the general council. The conditions
were extremely advantageous, as might well have been expected,
to the Roman Catholic claims. Nevertheless, they gave
complete satisfaction to neither party, and only animated to farther
arrogance the spirit of those whom they favoured.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Interim was promulgated at the Diet held at Augsbourg, and
it was followed by a long succession of conferences, which were
carried on at Leipzig and in other places, under the Protestant
auspices of Maurice of Saxony. Here was an excellent field for
the talents and character of Melancthon. All the public documents
of the Protestants were composed by him. All the acuteness of his
reason, all the graces of his style, all the resources of his learning
were brought into light and action; and much that he wrote in censure
of the Interim was written with force and truth. But here, as
on former occasions, the effects of his genius were marred by the very
moderation of his principles, and the practical result of his labours was
not beneficial to the cause which he intended to serve. For in this
instance he not only did not conciliate the enemies to whom he made
too large concessions, but he excited distrust and offence among his
friends; and these feelings were presently exasperated into absolute
schism.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the death of Luther, two years before these conferences, the
foremost place among the reformers had unquestionably devolved
upon Melancthon. He had deserved that eminence by his various
endowments, and his uninterrupted exertions: yet was he not the
character most fitted to occupy it at that crisis. His incurable thirst
for universal esteem and regard; his perpetual anxiety to soothe his
enemies and soften the bigotry of the hierarchy, frequently seduced
him into unworthy compromises, which lowered his own cause,
without obtaining either advantage or respect from his adversaries. It
is not thus that the ferocity of intolerance can be disarmed. The lust
of religious domination cannot be satisfied by soothing words, or
appeased by any exercise of religious charity. It is too blind to
imagine any motive for the moderation of an enemy, except the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>consciousness of weakness. It is too greedy to accept any partial
concession, except as a pledge of still farther humiliation, to end in
absolute submission. It can be successfully opposed only by the same
unbending resolution which itself displays, tempered by a calmer
judgment and animated by a more righteous purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general principle by which the controversial writings of
Melancthon at this time were guided was thisâthat there were
certain essentials which admitted of no compromise; but that the
Interim might be received as a rule, in respect to things which were
<em>indifferent</em>. Hence arose the necessary inquiry, what could properly
be termed indifferent. It was the object of Melancthon to extend
their number, so as to include as many as possible of the points in
dispute, and narrow the held of contention with the Roman Catholics.
In the pursuance of this charitable design he did not foreseeâfirst,
that he would not advance thereby a single step towards the conciliation
of their animosityânext, that he would sow amongst the
Reformers themselves the seeds of intestine discord: but so, unhappily,
it proved; and the feeble expedient which was intended to
repel the danger from without, multiplied that danger by introducing
schism and disorder within.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, we can scarcely wonder that it was so: for we find that
among the matters to be accounted indifferent, and under that name
conceded, Melancthon ventured to place the doctrine of justification
by faith alone; the necessity of good works to eternal salvation; the
number of the sacraments; the jurisdiction claimed by the pope and
the bishops; extreme unction; and the observance of certain religious
festivals, and several superstitious rites and ceremonies. It was not
possible that the more intimate associates of Lutherâthe men who
had struggled by his side, who were devoted to his person and his
memory, who inherited his opinions and his principles, and who
were animated by some portion of his zealâshould stand by in silence,
and permit some of the dearest objects of their own struggles and the
vigils of their master to be offered up to the foe by the irresolute
hand of Melancthon. Accordingly, a numerous party rose, who
disclaimed his principles and rejected his authority. At their head was
Illyricus Flacius, a fierce polemic, who possessed the intemperance
without the genius of Luther. The contest commonly known as the
Adiaphoristic Controversy broke out with great fury; it presently
extended its character so as to embrace various collateral points; and
the Roman Catholics were once more edified by the welcome spectacle
of Protestant dissension.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Melancthon held his last fruitless conference with the Roman
Catholics at Worms in the year 1557; and he died three years afterwards,
at the age of 63, the same age that had been attained by
Luther. His ashes were deposited at Wittemberg, in the same
church with those of his master; a circumstance which is thus simply
commemorated in his epitaph:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hic invicte tuus Collega, Luthere, Melancthon</span></div>

      <div class='line in2'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic sacer amborum jungit his ossa locus.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Some days before his death, while it was manifest that his end was
fast approaching, Melancthon wrote on a scrap of paper some of the
reasons which reconciled him to the prospect of his departure. Among
them were theseâthat he should see God and the Son of God; that
he should comprehend some mysteries which he was unable to
penetrate on earth, such as these:âwhy it is that we are created such
as we are? what was the union of the two natures in Jesus Christ?
that he should sin no more; that he should no longer be exposed to
vexations; and that he should escape <em>from the rage of the theologians</em>.
We need no better proof than this how his peaceable spirit had been
tortured during the decline of life by those interminable quarrels,
which were entirely repugnant to his temper, and yet were perpetually
forced upon him, and which even his own lenity had seemingly
tended to augment. And it is even probable that the theologians
from whose rage it was his especial hope to be delivered were those
who had risen up last against him, and with whom his differences
were as nothing compared to the points on which they were agreed,
his brother reformers. For being in this respect unfortunate, that
his endeavours to conciliate the affections of all parties had been
requited by the contempt and insults of all, he was yet more peculiarly
unhappy, that the blackest contumely and the bitterest insults proceeded
from the dissentients of his own. Thus situated, after forty
years of incessant exertions to reform, and at the same time to unite,
the Christian world, when he beheld discord multiplied, and its fruits
ripening in the very bosom of the Reformation; when he compared
his own principles and his own conscience with the taunts which were
cast against him; when he discovered how vain had been his mission
of conciliation, and how ungrateful a task it was to throw oil upon the
waters of theological controversy; when he reflected how much time
and forbearance he had wasted in this hopeless attempt,âhe could
scarcely avoid the unwelcome suspicion that his life had been, in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>degree, spent in vain, and that in one of the dearest objects of his
continual endeavours he had altogether failed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reason was, that the extreme mildness of his own disposition
blinded him to the very nature of religious contests, and inspired him
with amiable hopes which could not possibly be realized. He may
have been a better man than Luther; he may even have been a
wiser; he had as great acuteness; he had more learning and a purer
and more perspicuous style; he had a more charitable temper; he
had a more candid mind; and his love for justice and truth forbade
him to reject without due consideration even the argument of an
adversary. He was qualified to preside as a judge in the forum
of theological litigation; yet was he not well fitted for that which he
was called upon to discharge, the office of an advocate. He saw too
much, for he saw both sides of the question; his very knowledge,
acting upon his natural modesty, made him diffident. He balanced,
he reflected, he doubted; and he became, through that very virtue, a
tame sectarian and a feeble partisan.</p>

<p class='c000'>But his literary talents were of the highest order, and were directed
with great success to almost all the departments of learning. He
composed abridgments of all the branches of philosophy, which
continued long in use among the students of Germany, and purified
the liberal arts from the dross which was mixed up with them. And
it was thus that he would have purified religion; and as he had
introduced the one reformation without violence, so he thought to
accomplish the other without schism. But he comprehended not the
character of the Roman Catholic priesthood, nor could he conceive the
tenacity and the passion with which men, in other respects reasonable
and respectable, will cling to the interests, the prejudices, the abuses,
the very vices, which are associated with their profession. It was an
easy matter to him to confound the superstitious rites and tenets
of Rome by his profound learning and eloquent arguments; but it
was another and a far different task to deal with the offended feelings
of an implacable hierarchy. And thus it is, that while we admire his
various acquirements and eminent literary talents, and praise the
moderation of his charitable temper, we remark the wisdom of that
Providence which entrusted the arduous commencement of the work of
reformation to firmer and ruder hands than his.</p>

<p class='c000'>Melancthonâs printed works are very numerous. The most complete
edition of them is that of Wittemberg, in 1680,3, in four
volumes folio.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PITT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The observations made at the beginning of our memoir of Mr. Burke
(vol. iii. p. 33) apply with greater force to Mr. Pitt, on account both
of the more recent date of his death, and of the more important influence
which he exercised over our national welfare. We shall
therefore lay before the reader a very succinct account of this celebrated
statesman, endeavouring not to colour it by the introduction
of our own opinions, and avoiding any statements that can reasonably
be controverted. There can be no doubt as to Mr. Pittâs title to a
place in this work; but it is not here that those who have their opinion
still to form as to his character and policy should seek for the materials
to do so.</p>

<p class='c000'>William Pitt, the second son of the first Earl of Chatham, was born
at Hayes in Kent, May 28, 1759. He suffered much and frequently
from ill health until he had nearly reached the age of manhood; and
his delicacy of constitution prevented his reading for honours at Pembroke
College, Cambridge, of which he became a resident member at
the age of fourteen. He therefore took the honorary degree of M.A.,
to which his birth entitled him, in 1776. His private tutor and biographer,
the late Bishop of Winchester, has borne testimony to Mr.
Pittâs proficiency in scholarship at the time when he commenced his
residence, and to his diligent study of the ancient languages, of mathematics,
and of modern literature, during the long period of seven
years which he spent at Cambridge. His illustrious father was not
slow to perceive and appreciate this early promise; and the few letters
which are extant, addressed by Lord Chatham to his son, contain a
most pleasing picture of parental affection, confidence, and esteem.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Mr. Pitt was called to the bar June 12, 1780, and went the western
circuit in that year and the following. In January, 1781, he was
brought into parliament by Sir James Lowther, for the borough of
Appleby. He made his maiden speech in support of Mr. Burkeâs
bill for the reform of the civil list; and this being in great measure
in reply to former speakers, and therefore evidently not premeditated,
produced the greater effect, and amply satisfied public expectation,
which had been highly raised by his hereditary fame and reputed talents.
Young as he was, he took a leading part in denouncing the
impolicy and injustice of the American war, then drawing to its close,
and in effecting the downfall of Lord Northâs administration, which
occurred in March, 1782. In the Rockingham administration, which
followed, he bore no office: not that his talents were held cheap, for
he was offered several important places; but he had already determined,
as he declared soon afterwards, never to accept any office
without a seat in the cabinet. He gave his support, however, to the
measures of government; and, with a determination which he manifested
again at a later period, of securing his independence, he continued,
notwithstanding his brilliant prospects in public life, his professional
attendance at Westminster Hall. During this session he
distinguished himself as an advocate of parliamentary reform by supporting
three measures upon the subject: a motion, made by himself,
for a committee to examine into the state of representation of the
Commons; a bill for shortening the duration of parliaments; and a
bill for the prevention of bribery, and the diminution of expense
at elections. These, not being supported by government, were all
thrown out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The death of the Marquis of Rockingham, July 1, 1782, led to the
appointment of the Earl of Shelburne as prime-minister, and to Mr.
Foxâs retirement from office. Mr. Pitt, at the age of twenty-three,
was made Chancellor of the Exchequer. As a strong opposition was
expected in the next session of parliament, it became desirable to
effect a junction, if possible, with one of the adverse parties. Against
acting in concert with Lord North, Mr. Pitt had formed an unchangeable
determination; and the negotiation with Mr. Fox was stopped in
the outset by that gentlemanâs resolution not to act under Lord Shelburne.
Thus two of the three principal parties into which the House
of Commons was then divided were shut out of office during the continuance
of the existing administration; and a strong motive was given
them to unite, even against all probability, considering the virulent
hostility which had long existed between their leaders. Mr. Fox and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Lord North however did form their celebrated Coalition; and, in spite
of its unpopularity, had strength enough to turn out the Shelburne
ministry in the spring of 1783. Mr. Pitt, while in office, introduced
a bill for promoting economy, and removing many gross abuses in
various departments of the public service. This, after passing the
Commons, was thrown out by the Lords.</p>

<p class='c000'>The King, it is well known, was exceedingly averse to the re-admission
of Mr. Fox into office. He pressed the task of forming an
administration upon Mr. Pitt, who, being convinced that no effective
support could be hoped for, at that time, either in parliament or
from the expression of public opinion, steadily refused the offer.
The coalition ministry therefore came into power. In the session of
1783 Mr. Pitt again introduced the question of parliamentary reform,
in the shape of three resolutions, which provided that one hundred
members should be added to those returned by the counties and the
metropolis, and that all boroughs should be disfranchised where a
majority of voters had been proved guilty of corruption. These resolutions
were rejected.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the meeting of parliament in November, Mr. Fox brought forward
his celebrated India Bill. It was quickly carried through the
lower house, but was thrown out in the upper, partly through the
personal influence exerted by the King; and on the next day, December
18, Mr. Fox and Lord North received their dismissal. Mr.
Pitt did not now hesitate to take his place at the head of government.
He felt himself in a much stronger position than at the close of the
Shelburne administration. He foresaw that the India Bill would
become unpopular, though as yet little outcry had been made against
it, and he resolved, with a courage, ability, and penetration, which
those who condemn his conduct most strongly cannot deny, to
assume office in the teeth of a majority of the House of Commons,
and to hold it in spite of the majorities continually arrayed against
him. Nor, though strongly urged, would he resort to a dissolution;
knowing that such a measure would be fatal unless the new parliament
should prove much more favourable to him than the existing one,
being aware that Mr. Foxâs popularity, though shaken by the coalition,
was not overthrown, and trusting to the growing unpopularity of the
India Bill to dispose the nation more favourably to his own administration.
It was therefore resolved to continue the sitting parliament;
and the house adjourned on the 26th of December to the 12th of
January. During the recess Mr. Pitt gained the applause of all parties
by his disinterestedness in giving the valuable sinecure of Clerk of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>the Pells to Colonel BarrÃ©, on condition of his resigning a pension of
3000<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> a year; thus effecting a saving to the country of that amount.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 12th the new ministry was twice left in a minority, once of
thirty-nine, the second time of fifty-four. This not inducing them to
resign, a series of motions was made to compel them to do so. It
was never ventured however to stop the supplies. Between January
12 and March 8, fourteen motions, besides those which passed without
a division, were carried against the ministers with various but on the
whole decreasing majorities, the last only by a majority of one. This
ended the struggle. The minister saw that the time was now come
when a dissolution was likely to tell in his favour, and it took place
accordingly, March 25.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was now returned for the University of Cambridge. In the
ensuing session his attention was principally engaged by the Westminster
scrutiny, the state of the revenue, and the affairs of India.
In the first he took a part which widened the breach between Mr. Fox
and himself; and he had the mortification of being exposed to the
charge that he cherished personal animosity against his illustrious
antagonist, and of being deserted by many of his usual adherents,
and finally left in a minority, March 3, 1785, when the scrutiny was
ended by a vote of the house. Lord Hood and Mr. Fox were then
returned. In his financial measures Mr. Pitt had eminent success.
By economy, by resolutely facing the difficulties of the question, and,
no doubt, by the assistance of that general prosperity, agricultural as
well as commercial, which was beginning to succeed the depression of
the American war, the revenue, which at his accession to office was
considerably below the expenditure, was improved so much as, by the
spring of 1786, to afford the promise of a million surplus. This was
devoted to the formation of an effective sinking-fund. Mr. Pitt prided
himself on this more than any other of his measures, and resisted
all temptation to encroach upon it even during the pressing difficulties
of the latter years of his administration. The merit of having devised
the scheme was claimed by Dr. Price: be this as it may, the principal
merit, that of having rigidly carried it into execution, is Pittâs. Later
authorities have denied the advantage of the system altogether. The
India Bill, the other leading measure of this session, differed from
Mr. Foxâs chiefly in these important points, that the members of the
Board of Control, like other members of administration, were removable
at pleasure, and that nearly all the patronage of India was
left in the hands of the Board of Directors. In 1785, for the last time,
Mr. Pitt again brought forward the subject of parliamentary reform.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>His plan was to transfer the members of thirty-six decayed boroughs to
the metropolis and to various counties, and as other boroughs decayed,
to give their franchises to populous and increasing towns. But the
boroughs being regarded, in the words of his biographer, as âa
species of valuable property and private inheritance, the voluntary
surrender of their rights was not to be expected without an adequate
consideration.â This was not treated as a government measure, and
was rejected by a large majority.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other passages of most importance in Mr. Pittâs political life,
before the French Revolution, were his decided support of the impeachment
of Warren Hastings, though without going the whole
length of Mr. Burke and other opposition members, in 1786, and the
conclusion of a commercial treaty with France on a more liberal
footing than had yet been contemplated by the countries; the successful
opposition which he made to the repeal of the Test and Corporation
Acts, in 1787, notwithstanding the support he had received
from the Dissenters a few years before; his conduct on the Regency
Bill, in opposition to the ill-advised assertion of Mr. Fox, that the
Prince of Wales was entitled as a matter of right to the full possession
of the powers of royalty, as sole Regent, in 1788â9; and his support of
the abolition of the Slave Trade, for which he spoke and voted, but
without making it a ministerial question. Indeed, in consequence of
Mr. Wilberforceâs illness, Pitt was the first to bring that national disgrace
and crime under the notice of the house, and he exerted his
best eloquence in favour of its immediate abolition, and against the
temporising course which was adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>It does not appear that in the beginning of the French Revolution
Mr. Pitt anticipated any bad consequences to Great Britain, or that
he expected or wished to be led into that protracted war, which, though
ultimately triumphant, involved us in imminent danger, enormous
expense, and a debt still pressing us to the ground. At least, in
opening his budget in 1792, he spoke with more than usual confidence
of the favourable prospects of the revenue, and prognosticated
many years of peace. At the same time he was already impressed
with suspicion and fear of those in England who regarded with
complacency the dawning of the Revolution; and in the same session
he declared himself opposed to the introduction of Mr. Greyâs motion
for reform in parliament, on the express ground that menâs minds were
in a state of fermentation, which rendered any innovation inexpedient
and dangerous. But the events of the summer and autumn changed
Mr. Pittâs views more widely. After the deposition of Louis XVI., on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the 10th of August, the British minister at Paris was recalled; and as
soon as the news of that unhappy sovereignâs death reached England,
the French minister in London was ordered to quit the kingdom. War
was declared by France, February 1, 1793. We do not attempt to
compress the history of that eventful period into these pages. The
policy of our government was to make the sea the scene of our chief
exertions, and our fleets were victorious in every quarter of the
globe. By land the conduct of the war was most unsuccessful. We
were indeed cautious of risking our own troops on the continent; but
the national wealth was profusely spent in subsidizing other nations,
in combining alliances against France, which one after another proved
utterly unable to withstand the energy of the French government and
the talent of the republican generals, and in trifling expeditions,
injurious if they failed, and useless if successful. Meanwhile the
enormous expenditure of the day caused a corresponding increase of
the public burdens, and, as was foreboded, a ruinous accession to the
public debt. A large party, who were far from joining with those
that would willingly have made England the subject of an experiment
similar to the one going on in France, denied both the necessity and
the expediency of the contest in which we were engaged; party spirit
reached a frantic height; and these men, as sincere friends to their
country as those who most strenuously supported the arbitrary
measures of government, were denounced, and confounded with the
small minority really hostile to domestic order. And no doubt the
oppressive conduct of the administration drove many persons to
extremes, which, in cooler moments and under a more equitable
policy, they would not have countenanced. Then came the trials of
Muir and Palmer in Scotland, in 1793, of Hardy and Horne Tooke
in 1794, the Alien Bill, the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act,
and other measures calculated, in the language of the times, to prevent
the spread of revolutionary principles, for which the minister was hailed
by one party as the saviour of his country from anarchy, and denounced
by another as a pillar of despotism, an enemy to the free constitution of
his country, a deserter from the principles of his youth, and a persecutor
of those associates who still adhered to them. Increased discontent
was met by increased severity; and, after the insults offered to the
Kingâs person as he proceeded to open the session of parliament in
1796, the famous bills, for the prevention of seditious meetings and
for the better security of his Majestyâs person and government, commonly
called the Pitt and Grenville Acts, were introduced and carried,
not without the utmost indignation and the most determined opposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>by all means short of forcible resistance, both within the walls of
parliament and without.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Fox and the other chief members of opposition, finding their
utmost efforts unsuccessful, seceded openly from the House of Commons
when the Seditious Meetings Bill went into committee. Meanwhile
the country was beset by the most serious difficulties. The
drain of specie produced by our subsidies to foreign powers, the large
advances required from the Bank by government, and the disposition to
hoard money produced by the fear of invasion and of domestic anarchy,
gave reason to apprehend that the Bank would be unable to meet its
engagements; and in 1797 it was relieved by the Restriction Act from
the obligation of paying cash in exchange for its notes. In the same
year the mutiny at the Nore broke out; and in 1798 the rebellion in
Ireland made a most formidable addition to the dangers and distresses
of the nation. Meanwhile our exertions had been powerless to check
the victorious arms of France on the continent of Europe, and a strong
desire for peace was felt by many who had been Mr. Pittâs staunch
supporters, and advocates of the revolutionary war. This led to his
retirement from office in 1801, unless that event is rather to be ascribed
to the Kingâs fixed determination not to grant the Irish Catholics that
full relief, which had been held out as one inducement to procure
the consent of Ireland to the Act of Union. It is to Mr. Pitt that
the merit of carrying through that important measure is due; a measure
which would probably have been attended with much more beneficial
results if the policy of its author with respect to Catholic Emancipation
had been adopted. But even the importance of the object
is insufficient to justify, and can only palliate, the corrupt means which
were used in gaining the assent of the Irish parliament to the Union,
which was very unpopular with the Irish nation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Pitt resigned his office in February, 1801, and was succeeded
by Mr. Addington, who concluded the peace of Amiens in 1802, the
preliminaries having been signed the autumn before. Mr. Pitt
defended the conditions of this treaty when attacked in parliament,
therein taking a different part from several of his late colleagues. But
his retirement in the first instance was regarded as not much more
than nominal, and he was generally thought to be the adviser of the
ministry after he ceased to belong to it. This state of affairs however
was short-lived. His support gradually subsided, first into coldness,
then into avowed disapprobation, and finally into hostility not less
decided than that of the regular opposition. In the early part of
1804, after the lapse of twenty years of violent hostility, Pitt and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Fox were again seen speaking and voting on the same side. A
fruitless attempt was made by the ministry to procure the accession
of the former; and as it became clear that the existing government
could not stand, and as the lapse of time and change in affairs had
removed many of the most irreconcileable grounds of party variance,
a strong hope was felt that an administration, uniting the best talents
and most powerful interests of the country, might be formed by
the junction of the three parties represented by Mr. Pitt, Mr. Fox,
and Lord Grenville. This hope appears to have been defeated by
the Kingâs personal objections to admit Mr. Fox to office. It is
asserted by Mr. Rose that Mr. Pitt used his utmost endeavours to
overcome that prejudice, âconceiving a strong government as important
to the public welfare, and as calculated to call forth the united
talents as well as the utmost resources of the empire; in which endeavour
he persisted till within a few months of his death.â Unfortunately
for his own fame, and probably for the interests of the country, he did
not think fit to make this union of parties a condition of his own return
to office. Lord Grenville, his relation, friend, and coadjutor, refused
to become a member of an exclusive ministry, and Mr. Pitt took his
station at the head of a cabinet singularly deficient in men of commanding
talent, and more than half composed of Mr. Addingtonâs
colleagues. The disappointment of the nation was great; but the
late period of the session (he was gazetted First Lord of the Treasury
May 12) was of material service in enabling him to face the difficulties
of his position; and he employed the autumn in seeking to
gain strength by forming an alliance with some other party. Lord
Grenville however proved firm in his resolution not to accept office
while Mr. Fox was excluded; and the minister, assuredly with deep
mortification, was compelled to make overtures of reconciliation to
Mr. Addington, who was created Viscount Sidmouth, and appointed
President of the Council in January, 1805. This alliance after all
proved inefficient to strengthen the government, while it was fruitful
in jealousies, which led to Lord Sidmouthâs speedy retirement from
office in July; and in the same session the dismissal, and ultimately
the impeachment, of his old and valued friend and ablest coadjutor,
Mr. Dundas, now created Viscount Melville, added another and a still
more distressing embarrassment to those by which the minister was
already beset.</p>

<p class='c000'>On his return to office Mr. Pitt had again recourse to his former
policy of raising up continental alliances against France; and he succeeded
in uniting Austria and Russia in the confederacy which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>crushed by the decisive battle of Austerlitz, December 2, 1805. At
this time his constitution was rapidly giving way, exhausted by a life
of excessive labour, which he sought to relieve by the immoderate use
of wine, a habit first induced by the original defects in his constitution.
In December he was ordered by his physicians to Bath, but
he received no benefit from the change of place, and returned to his
residence at Putney by slow stages. He expired January 23, 1805.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to his other offices, Mr. Pitt held the sinecure of Warden
of the Cinque Ports, worth about 3000<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> per annum, which, unsolicited,
was bestowed on him by the King in 1792, as a mark of
personal esteem. But the pressure of public business left no time for
the regulation of his domestic affairs, and, notwithstanding his large
income, he expended his small patrimonial estate, and died deeply
involved in debt. The parliament was not slow to acknowledge his
long services. His remains were interred at the public expense; a
monument was erected to him in Westminster Abbey; 40,000<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> were
voted to discharge his debts; and, in conformity to his dying request,
a pension of 1500<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> was conferred on his nieces, daughters of the
Earl of Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>We abstain, for the reasons already assigned, from attempting to
give a summary of Mr. Pittâs qualifications and merits as a statesman,
but it is a debt of justice to bear testimony to his unimpeached
integrity in all pecuniary affairs. As a speaker he possessed extraordinary
powers; clear, fluent, and singularly correct in his diction,
unimpassioned, and seldom rising into flights of eloquence, he was
always ready to profit by the indiscretions of an opponent, and his
sarcasm was of the most cutting and effective kind. His argumentative
powers were of a high order, and the clearness and precision
of his mind fitted him admirably for those minute financial statements
which formed an important part of his official duties. His voice,
though wanting in variety, was sonorous and impressive in an extraordinary
degree; his action, though awkward and ungainly at first
sight, was not unpleasing, nor unsuited to his discourse. In the
relations of private life his character was unexceptionable. âWith a
manner somewhat reserved and distant, in what might be termed his
public deportment, no man was ever better qualified to gain, or more
successful in fixing, the attachment of his friends, than Mr. Pitt. They
saw all the powerful energies of his character softened into the most
perfect complacency and sweetness of disposition in the circles of private
life, the pleasures of which no one more enjoyed, or more agreeably
promoted, where the paramount duties he conceived himself to owe to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>the public admitted of his mixing in them; that indignant severity
with which he met and subdued what he considered unfounded opposition,
that keenness of sarcasm with which he repelled and withered
(as it might be said) the powers of most of his assailants in debate,
were exchanged, in the society of his intimate friends, for a kindness
of heart, a gentleness of demeanour, and a playfulness of good humour,
which none ever witnessed without interest, or participated without
delight.â Such is the testimony borne to Mr. Pittâs social qualities
by his intimate and attached friend, the Hon. George Rose, in his
âBrief Examination into the Increase of the Revenue, &amp;c. of Great
Britain, during Mr. Pittâs administration.â</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>WESLEY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Samuel Wesley, whose mother was a niece of Thomas Fuller, the
church historian, was in his earliest years thrown by family circumstances
among the party of the dissenters; but he abandoned them in
disgust, and entered at Exeter College, Oxford, in 1684. He afterwards
obtained the livings of Epworth and Wroote, in Lincolnshire;
and at the former of those places, June 17, 1703, was born his second
son John. Six years afterwards, the house was set on fire by some
refractory parishioners, and the boy was forgotten in the first confusion.
He was presently discovered at a window, and by great exertion rescued
at the very moment which promised to be his last. John Wesley
saw the hand of Providence in this preservation, and made it in after
life a subject of reflection and gratitude.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the age of seventeen he was removed from the Charterhouse
School, where he had made some proficiency, to Christchurch, Oxford;
and the reputation by which he was then distinguished was that of a
skilful logician and acute disputant. He was destined for the Church;
and when the time for ordination arrived, after some faint scruples
which he professed respecting the damnatory clauses of the Athanasian
Creed and the supposed Calvinistic tendency discoverable in
the Articles had been removed, he entered into orders; and, as the
book which had especially excited him on the most serious meditation
to undertake that office was Jeremy Taylorâs âRules of Holy Living
and Dying,â so was it with the deepest earnestness that his resolution
was taken, and with a fixed determination to dedicate his life and his
death, his whole thoughts, feelings and energies, to the service of God.
Accordingly, in the selection of his acquaintance, he avoided all who
did not embrace his principles; and having now obtained a fellowship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>at Lincoln College, he had the means of assembling round him a little
society of religious friends or disciples, over whom his superior talents
and piety gave him a natural influence. These, through their strict
and methodical manner of living, acquired from their fellow-students
the appellation of Methodists,âa name derived from the schools of
ancient science, and thus destined, through its capricious application
by a few thoughtless boys, to designate a large and vital portion of the
Christian world.</p>

<p class='c000'>About this time Wesley entered upon his parochial duties as his
fatherâs curate at Epworth<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a>, and presently afterwards, on the approaching
death of that respectable person, he was strongly urged by
his family to obtain, as he probably might have done, the next presentation
for himself. Had he yielded to their solicitations, he might have
passed his days in humble and peaceful obscurity; but his mind was
too large for the limits of a country parish, and he already felt that he
was intended to serve his Maker in a larger field. So, evading the
arguments and withstanding the entreaties of his friends, he went back
to reside for a while upon his fellowship at Oxford.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It was, strictly speaking, during this his absence from Oxford that his little society
then (of which the leading member was his younger brother Charles) acquired the
name of Methodist.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1735 he engaged in the more public exercise of the
ministry in the character of a missionary. He set sail for the new
colony of Georgia in America; he had the countenance of the civil
authorities, and the object which he principally professed was the
conversion of the Indians. His habits at this period were deeply
tinged with ascetism. In his extreme self-denial and mortification,
in respect to diet, clothing, and the ordinary comforts of life, he
affected a more than monastic austerity, and realized the tales of
eremitical fanaticism. He even declaimed against the study of classical
authors, and discouraged, as sinful, any application to profane
literature. And the extravagance of his zeal took a direction, such
indeed as might be expected from his birth and education, but ill
adapted to recommend him to the affections of the colonists. He adhered,
with the obstinacy of a bigot, to the rubric of the Church; he
refused to administer baptism except by immersion; he withheld the
communion from a pious dissenter, unless he should first consent to
be rebaptized; he declined to perform the burial service over another;
and while he was exciting much enmity by this excessive strictness,
he formed an indiscreet, though innocent, connexion with a young woman
named Sophia Causton, which led him into difficulty, and occasioned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>after some ludicrous and some very serious scenes, his sudden
and not very creditable departure from America.</p>

<p class='c000'>He remained there a year and nine months without making, so far
as we learn, a single attempt to introduce Christianity among the
Indians. He alleged that the Indians had expressed no wish for
conversion; and if his conscience was indeed thus easily satisfied, he
was yet very far removed from Christian perfection. Thus much
indeed he certainly appears to have learnt from this first experiment
on his own powers, that he was not yet qualified for the office of
missionary; for he felt that he, who would have converted others,
was not yet converted himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wesley had sailed to America in the society of some Moravian
missionaries, whose exalted piety had wrought deeply on his feelings,
and given them some influence over his conduct. On his return to
England, while he was already impressed with some sense of his own
unworthiness, he became closely connected with Peter Boehler, a man
of talents and authority, and a Moravian. Through his instructions
Wesley became thoroughly convinced of his own unbelief, and began
to pray, with all the ardour of his enthusiastic soul, for an instantaneous
conversion. It was not long before he believed that this blessing was
vouchsafed to him. On the evening of the 24th of May, 1738, as one
of a society in Aldersgate Street was reading in his presence Lutherâs
âPreface to the Epistle to the Romans,âââAbout a quarter before
nine,â says Wesley, âwhile he was describing the change which God
works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely
warmed; I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation; and
an assurance was given me that He had taken away <em>my</em> sins, even
<em>mine</em>, and saved <em>me</em> from the law of sin and death.â Howbeit, when
he returned home, he had still some more struggles with the evil one,
and was again buffeted by temptations; but he was now triumphant
through earnest prayer. âAnd herein,â he adds, âI found the difference
between this and my former state chiefly to consist. I was
striving, yea fighting, with all my might under the law, as well as
under grace; but then I was sometimes, if not often, conquered; now
I am always conqueror.â This is justly considered as a remarkable
day in the history of methodism; and Wesley himself attached so
much importance to the change that had been wrought in him, that
he scrupled not to proclaim, to the great scandal of some of his unregenerate
friends, that he had never been a Christian until then.</p>

<p class='c000'>His first act after his conversion was to set out on a visit to the
celebrated Moravian colony, established under the patronage of Count
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Zinzendorf, at Herrnhut in Lusatia. There he employed a fortnight
in examining the doctrines and discipline of that sect, and
then returned, as he went, on foot. âI would gladly have spent my
life here; but my Master calling me to labour in another part of the
vineyard, I was constrained to take my leave of this happy place.â
Yet he perceived clearly enough the imperfections in their method;
and his intercourse with their noble patron was not such as to flatter
the ambition, or even the independence, of his character. But he had
acquired a knowledge of their system, and was thus qualified to apply
to his own purposes any part of it which might hereafter serve them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wesley returned from his visit to Germany burning with religious
enthusiasm, and presently entered into the path which Whitefield, his
friend and disciple, had opened for him. The latter, who was a few
years younger than Wesley, and like him educated at Oxford, and in
orders, had begun a short time before to address the people in the
open air, at Kingswood near Bristol. Wesley, after some little hesitation,
proceeding from his respect for ecclesiastical practice and discipline,
followed his example, and commenced his field-preaching in
the same place. Here was the first indication of any approach to a
separation from the Church, and thus in fact were laid the foundations
of the sect of Methodists; yet such was not the design, perhaps, of
either of its founders,âcertainly not of Wesley. His scheme, if
indeed he had then proposed to himself any fixed scheme, was rather
to awaken the spirit of religion slumbering within the Church,âto revive
the dying embers of vital Christianity,âto infuse into the languid
system new life and energy,âto place before the eyes of the people the
essentials of their faith, and to rouse their religious instructors to a
proper view of their profession and sense of their duty. It was rather
an order than a sect that he designed to found; an order subsidiary to
the Church, in rivalry indeed with the ancient branches of the Establishment,
but filled with no hostile spirit, and having no final object
but its regeneration. Such as were the Mendicants in respect to the
Roman Church; severe in their reproaches against the indolence and
degeneracy of the clergy, whether regular or secular; severe in their
own professions, and for a season in their piety and practice too;
making their earnest appeals to the lower classes, and turning their
influence with them to their own aggrandizement; yet so far removed
from schism, so far from harbouring any ill designs against the papacy,
as to be the warmest zealots of the Vatican, and the most faithful
ministers of all its projects:âsuch (so far as the change in civil and
ecclesiastical principles would permit) the disciples of Wesley were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>probably designed to have become, in respect to the English Church,
by the original intention of their master. At any rate, it was certain
that the emulation, which he could not fail to rouse, would in the end
be serviceable to the interests of true religion; and it is very possible
that, in the depth of his enthusiasm, he held every other consideration
to be entirely subordinate to this.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first effects of his public preaching have not been surpassed by
any thing that we read in the history of fanaticism. On one occasion,
as he was inculcating the doctrine of universal redemption, âimmediately
one, and another, and another, sank to the earth; they dropped
down on every side as thunderstruck.â Sometimes, as he began to
preach, numbers of his believers fell into violent fits and lay struggling
in convulsions around him. At other times his voice was lost amidst
the groans and cries of his distracted hearers. Wesley encouraged
the storm which he had raised; he shared the fanaticism which he
imparted; and in these deplorable spectacles of human imbecility he
saw nothing but the hand of God confirming by miraculous interposition
the holiness of his mission.</p>

<p class='c000'>But however elated the preacher might be by these spiritual triumphs,
however confident in the immediate aid and favour of God, he did not
neglect such human means as occurred to him for securing and advancing
his conquests. At a very early period he divided his followers at
Bristol into male and female <em>bands</em>, for purposes of mutual confession
and prayer, in imitation of one part of the Moravian discipline. The
establishment of love feasts was equally early. Presently Friday was
set apart by him for prayer and fasting; and a house was erected (likewise
at Bristol) for the meeting of his disciples. Things were already
advancing towards schism. The directors of the church discouraged
the extravagance of the teacher, and pitied the madness of the people.
Many clergymen, with praiseworthy discretion, refused their pulpits to
men who might turn them to such strange purposes. And this gave
a pretext to Wesley for seeking means of instructing the people independent
of the Church.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the mean time he discovered that there were differences between
himself and those with whom he had hitherto been most closely connectedâdifferences
the more difficult to reconcile, because they concerned
points of doctrineâthe one with the Moravians, the other with
Whitefield and his followers. For the arrangement of the former,
Count Zinzendorf came in person to England, and had some conferences
with Wesleyâbut he no longer found in him a timid disciple, or obsequious
admirer. Wesley defended fearlessly the opinions which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>professed, concerning Christian perfection and the means of grace;
and as no concession was possible on the other side, the controversy
ended in an entire and final breach between him and the Moravians.
The dispute with Whitefield, occasioned by the predestinarian doctrines
now nakedly advanced by him, was conducted with considerable bitterness,
and came to a similar termination. Not that the separation was
in this case so complete as to preclude a temporary reconciliation, which
was effected some years afterwards; but the difference was clearly
proved to be real and irreconcileable; and the permanent division of
methodism may in fact be dated from the year 1740.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this time Wesley, having shaken off two connexions which
had embarrassed more than they had strengthened him, became the
sole head and mover of a considerable religious party: and he immediately
applied his talents to give it organization and perpetuity. He
divided his followers into <em>classes</em>, each under the direction of a leader.
He caused pecuniary contributions to be collected from the individuals
composing those classes, so as to establish a permanent fund for the
support of his society, bearing an exact proportion to the number of its
members. He appointed itinerant preachers, and instructed them to
preach in the open air, under the plea that they were excluded from
the pulpits of the Church. And lastly and reluctantly,âfor he still
retained much affection for that Church, and could not be blind to the
consequences of the measure,âhe committed the office of preaching to
laymen. In the first instance, indeed, he conceded to them no more
than the privilege of expounding the Gospel; but seeing how soon they
deviated from exposition into preaching, he thought it wiser at once to
acknowledge the latter as a part of his system, and thus acquire the
power of preventing, as far as might be, its abuse. These men were,
for the most part, humbly born and ill educated. But their zeal supplied,
in popular estimation, the place of learning; and their habits
of poverty enabled them to endure the privations incident to the missionary
of a new sect. Thus were their labours attended with great
success; and this was essentially promoted by a very sage provision of
Wesley, that no confession of faith should be required on admission
into his community. The door was thus open to all mankind. The
new member was never called upon to secede from the body to which
he had previously belonged. He might bear what denomination he
chose among the visible members of Christâs Church, so long as he
renounced his vices and his pleasures, and engaged with a regenerate
heart in the work of his salvation.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time (about 1742) Wesley and his disciples attained that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>degree of importance, which qualified them to become objects of persecution.
It was among the lower classes that they had thrown the
torch of fanaticism, and it was from the same that the outrages which
now assailed them proceeded. On two or three occasions the person
of the master himself was in some danger from popular fury; and
it may perhaps have been preserved by his singular presence of mind,
and the awe which he knew how to inspire into his fellow creatures.
But these violent eruptions of indignation, as they were founded on no
semblance of reason, and opposed by the civil authorities, were partial
and of short duration; and as the rumours of them were much exaggerated
at the time, their influence, as far as they had any, was probably
favorable to the progress of methodism. Some calumnies that were
raised against Wesley from more respectable quarters, touching his tendency
to papacy and his disaffection to the reigning dynasty, arising
from entire misunderstanding or pure malevolence, were immediately
repelled, and speedily silenced and forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1744 Wesley invited his brother Charles, four other
clergymen who co-operated with him, and four of his lay-preachers to
a <em>Conference</em>: this was the origin of the assembly or council, which
was afterwards held annually, and became the governing body, for the
regulation of the general affairs of the society. Four years subsequently,
a school was opened at Kingswood, for the education chiefly of the sons
of the preachers. In the extreme severity of some of the rules which he
imposed on this establishment, Wesley seems to have been guided by an
ambitious design to set apart his own people from the rest of the community,
rather than by the common principles of education, or the common
feelings of nature. And so jealous was he of any other influence
being exerted on his children, that they were not allowed to be absent
from the school, not even for a day, from their first admission till their
final removal from it. Notwithstanding however the peculiarity and, as
he thought, the purity of his system, he met with many difficulties and
reverses, in his first attempts to place it on a permanent foundation.</p>

<p class='c000'>We may pass over the circumstances of his unfortunate marriage,
which ended, after a few months of discord and vexation, in a hasty but
final separation. His wife, after proving herself his foulest slanderer
and bitterest enemy, presently deserted him. â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non eam reliqui</span> (says
Wesley)â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non dimisi</span>â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non revocabo</span>.â âI have not left herâI have
not put her awayâI will not recall her.â The same calmness of temper
and perfect self-possession, which so remarkably distinguished him
in his public proceedings, seem not to have abandoned him even in the
more pressing severity of his domestic trials.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Neither have we space to notice the controversies which he carried
on with two of the most eminent divines of his time, bishops Lavington
and Warburton; since Wesley, though engaged in dispute with the prelates
of the Church, and very frequent and bitter in the reproaches
which he cast against its ministers, still adhered to its communion, and
had yet committed no act declaratory of absolute independence. But
later in life he advanced farther towards schism. First of all, as he
did not assume for his lay-preachers the power of administering the
sacrament, he caused several to be ordained by one Erasmus, a Greek
Bishop of Arcadiaâthus evading the spiritual authority, which he
could not contest, and which he did not yet venture to dispense with.
But this was a feeble resource, unworthy of his courage, and unavailing
to his purposes. A stronger measure followed. His disciples were very
numerous in America, and it was desirable to send out to them a head,
invested with the highest spiritual authority. Dr. Coke, an âevangelicalâ
clergyman, was selected for that office, and Wesley took upon
himself to invest him with the requisite dignity. These letters of ordination
are dated September 2, 1784, and announce in substance, that
Wesley thought himself providentially called, at that time, to set apart
some persons for the work of the ministry in America; and therefore,
under the protection of Almighty God, and with a single eye to his
glory, had that day set apart, as a superintendent, by the imposition
of his hands and prayer, Thomas Coke, a doctor of civil law, and a
presbyter of the Church of England.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this affair, it was weak in Wesley to plead (as he did) a seasonable
conviction, that in the true primitive Church the order of bishop
and presbyter were one and the sameâfor if Wesley exercised as presbyter
episcopal authority, so, under the same plea, might Dr. Coke
have exercised it, without any imposition of Wesleyâs hands. This was
a shallow pretence, which could scarcely have deceived himself. The
fact was, that Wesley, now acting as the sole head of a separate religious
party, assumed the prerogatives of the highest ecclesiastical
dignity; and resolved that all the privileges of his ministers should
emanate from himself. This is properly considered as a second important
epoch in the history of methodism.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wesley was then eighty-one years old, and he lived for seven years
longer, in the perfect enjoyment of his health and exercise of his
faculties, almost to the very end. He died March 2, 1791: leaving
no property, except the copyright and current editions of his works,
which he bequeathed for the use of the connexion. The whole number
of his followers, at the time of his decease, is stated at about 135,000,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>of whom more than 57,600 were Americans. In the United Kingdoms,
his principal success had been in some of the large towns in England
and in Ireland. But he complains of the coldness with which his
preaching was, for the most part, received by the agricultural classes
generally, and by the entire Scotch nationâfacts which may however
be accounted for, without supposing any religious obduracy either in
the one or the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus did Wesley live to fix and consolidate, by the calmer deliberation
of his later years, the effects, which might otherwise have been
transient, of his early enthusiasm. It required many talents, as well
as many virtues, to accomplish thisâand Wesley was abundantly endowed
with both. The natural ardour and eagerness of his character
was moderated by great sagacity and calm judgment, a conciliating
and forgiving temper. If he loved power, he did not covet money;
but bestowed all that he had upon the poor. Doubtless his original
object was simply to awaken the dormant spirit of vital Christianity;
and if spiritual ambition, fomented by the general discouragement
which he received from the clergy, seduced him too readilyâthough
reluctantly and in opposition to his own professions, and even to his own
intentionsâinto what did in fact amount to schism; yet the breach is
not even now irreparable, if only his better spirit shall preside in the
councils of his disciples, and be met with a kindred feeling of religious
moderation by the directors of the Established Church.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>The incident which immediately led to the invention of the power-loom
is best related in the words of the inventor himself. âHappening
to be at Matlock in the summer of 1784, I fell in company with
some gentlemen of Manchester, when the conversation turned on
Arkwrightâs spinning machinery. One of the company observed, that
as soon as Arkwrightâs patent expired, so many mills would be
erected, and so much cotton spun, that hands never could be found to
weave it. To this observation I replied, that Arkwright must then
set his wits to work to invent a weaving mill. This brought on a
conversation on the subject, in which the Manchester gentlemen unanimously
agreed that the thing was impracticable; and in defence of
their opinion, they adduced arguments which I certainly was incompetent
to answer, or even to comprehend, being totally ignorant of the
subject, having never at that time seen a person weave. I controverted
however the impracticability of the thing.â Looms driven by
power had been constructed before, but they had not been made to
answer; and it is probable, from the circumstances of Dr. Cartwrightâs
life, that he had never heard of them: at all events the idea thus
suggested to him did not lie dormant. Before the following April, he
had constructed his first power-loom; and he took out his last weaving
patent Aug. 1, 1787. Mechanical spinning therefore was the parent
of mechanical weaving. Without the former, the latter would have
been needless; without the latter, the former would have been incomplete.
Every stage of the cotton manufacture, from the cleaning of
the raw wool to the formation of a perfect web, may be, and in many
establishments is, now carried on under the same roof, and by the
moving power of the same engine. The name of Dr. Cartwright
should follow that of Sir Richard Arkwright in the list of our
national benefactors; though at present it is far less known to the
world at large. It was long indeed before Cartwrightâs merits were
appreciated, and they failed to obtain for him the wealth and distinction
which the creation of the factory system secured to Arkwright.
The utility of the power-loom is now acknowledged, and its sphere
appears to be rapidly enlarging. But it is still limited even in the
cotton, and much more in the silk and woollen manufactures; and
it is not unreasonable to expect that, as prejudices give way, and fresh
refinements render the machine susceptible of more general, not to
say universal, application, the art of weaving by mechanism, as formerly
of spinning, may give an impulse to our trade, of which we
now see the beginning, but cannot conjecture the end.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Edmund Cartwright was the fourth son of William Cartwright,
Esq., of Marnham in Nottinghamshire, a gentleman whose family had
been long established in the county, and had suffered considerably in
its fortune by adherence to the cause of Charles I. in the civil war.
He was born April 24, 1743; and at the school of Wakefield, and at
University College, Oxford, received the education usually bestowed
upon young men destined for the clerical profession. At an early
age he manifested a taste for poetic composition; but though he had
printed some short pieces anonymously, his name was not given to the
public, until the appearance, in 1770, of âArmenia and Elvira,â a
legendary poem, which became so popular that it passed through
seven editions in little more than a year. He also published, about
the same period, the âPrince of Peace,â and âSonnets to Eminent
Men.â In 1774 he became a contributor to the Monthly Review, in
which he continued to write for ten years.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have not ascertained the date of his taking orders, of his election
to a fellowship at Magdalen College, or of his vacating that fellowship
by marriage. The degree of D.D. he took in 1806. For some years
after his marriage he resided, first on his living at Brampton in Derbyshire,
and afterwards at Goadby-Marwood in Leicestershire; where
the hours which were not devoted to the duties of his calling were
chiefly employed in literary pursuits.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hitherto Mr. Cartwrightâs private life had been that of a retired
country clergyman, varied only by his correspondence with literary
friends. From his family connexions, and the esteem in which he was
held by some who had power to advance him, his prospects in the
church were favourable; and he had good reason to believe, that if he
had confined himself to the line of life in which he had been educated,
and in which he was then advancing, he would have attained a more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>ample provision in his profession, than it was his lot to acquire by the
exercise of his mechanical talent. The existence of such a talent in
his own mind had been wholly unknown even to himself, until he was
upwards of forty years of age, when the circumstance which has been
above narrated called it into action, and caused a change in the whole
tenor of his life. In his first attempts he had to contend with the difficulties
which usually beset genius without experience. âAs I had
never before turned my thoughts to anything mechanical, either in
theory or practice, nor had even seen a loom at work, or knew anything
of its construction, you will readily believe that my first loom
was a most rude piece of machinery. The warp was placed perpendicularly;
the reed fell with the weight of at least half a hundred
weight, and the springs which threw the shuttle were strong enough
to have thrown a Congreve rocket. In short, it required the strength
of two powerful men to work the machine at a slow rate, and only for
a short time.â This, as we have seen, was in 1785: he also applied
his talents to effecting the substitution of machinery for manual labour
in combing wool, and took out his first patent on this subject in April
1790.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following anecdotes we quote from the âPursuit of Knowledge,â
vol. ii.; we believe them to rest upon the best authority. âDr. Cartwrightâs
children still remember often seeing their father about this
time walking to and fro apparently in deep meditation, and occasionally
throwing his arms from side to side; on which they used to be told
that he was thinking of weaving and throwing the shuttle. From the
moment indeed when his attention was first turned to the invention of
the power-loom, mechanical contrivance became the grand occupying
subject of his thoughts. With that sanguineness of disposition which
seems to be almost a necessary part of the character of an inventor, he
looked on difficulties, when he met with them in any of his attempts,
as only affording his genius occasion for a more distinguished triumph:
nor did he allow even repeated failures for a moment to dishearten
him. Some time after he had brought his first loom to perfection, a
manufacturer, who had called upon him to see it at work, after expressing
his admiration of the ingenuity displayed in it, remarked,
that wonderful as was Mr. Cartwrightâs mechanical skill, there was
one thing that would effectually baffle him, namely the weaving of
patterns in checks, or in other words, the combining in the same web,
of a pattern, or fancy figure, with the crossing colours which constitute
the check. Mr. Cartwright made no reply to this observation at
the time; but some weeks after, on receiving a second visit from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>same person, he had the pleasure of showing him a piece of muslin of
the description mentioned, beautifully executed by machinery. The
man is said to have been so much astonished, that he roundly declared
his conviction that some agency more than human must have been
called in on the occasion.â</p>

<p class='c000'>The prejudices and opposition which Dr. Cartwrightâs invention
encountered from the manufacturers, stood greatly in the way of any
general adoption of his loom during the period of his patent rights.
Other causes, however, were concerned in this. A mill, containing
five hundred of his looms, was burnt down almost immediately after
its erection. He engaged in a concern for manufacturing with power-looms
at Doncaster; but this proved unsuccessful. And it is not
improbable, though we have not found it expressly stated, that the
machine itself was not at this time able to compete, in respect of
economy and beauty of workmanship, with hand labour: for during
the period of his exclusive rights, two or three other persons took out
patents for power-looms, without being able to make them answer. But
about the year 1801, in which his patent expired, he had the pleasure
of finding that his invention was coming into use to a very considerable
extent; and the mortification of seeing others reap the fruit of
his unrequited ingenuity. The increased demand during the war for
English cotton goods, with the necessity for working up at home the
cotton yarn which had hitherto been exported to the Continent, had
given an impulse to the manufacture favourable to the introduction of
machinery; and at the same time the power-loom was rendered much
more economical by a very ingenious method, invented by Mr. Radcliffe
of Stockport, about 1804, of dressing or sizing the warp, before
it was placed in the loom. A cotton manufacturer of Stockport,
named Horrocks, took out a patent for another power-loom in 1803.
He failed; but his loom, with various modifications, is that which has
now come into general use.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following estimate, taken from âBainesâs History of the Cotton
Manufacture,â of the number of power-looms in Britain at various
periods, though literal exactness in such a matter is unattainable,
affords probably a tolerably correct measure of the rapid multiplication
of these engines.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>At the present time, we are told by the same authority, the machinemakers
of Lancashire are making power-looms with the greatest rapidity,
and they cannot be made sufficiently fast to meet the demands
of the manufacturers. This quick increase, notwithstanding the considerable
expense of outfit, which by employing hand-weavers the
manufacturer avoids entirely, may safely be taken as a test of the advantages
and national importance of the power-loom. The following
estimate is given of its productiveness as compared with hand-loom
labour. A very good hand-weaver, twenty-five or thirty years of
age, will weave <em>two</em> pieces of cloth per week, of a certain description,
each twenty-four yards long. In 1833, a steam-loom weaver, from
fifteen to twenty years of age, assisted by a girl about twelve years of
age, attending to four looms, can weave <em>eighteen</em> similar pieces in a
week; some can weave twenty pieces. It appears from the fuller
statement given by Mr. Baines, that the comparative productiveness
of steam-looms has rapidly increased up to the last-mentioned period,
and therefore it may be conjectured not yet to have reached its
maximum; and it is also stated, that in those descriptions of plain
goods for which they have hitherto been chiefly used, âcloth made
by these looms, when seen by those manufacturers who employ hand-weavers,
at once, excites admiration, and a consciousness that their
own weavers cannot equal it.â The set-off against these advantages
is the interest on capital employed, and the expense of supplying
power. It is not asserted by the more intelligent, either among
masters or workmen, that the power-loom has been more than a
secondary and minor cause of the lamentable depression and misery
now existing among the hand-weavers; a depression which it is to
be feared will never be removed but by the gradual relinquishment
of that laborious and ill-paid trade.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hardships of Dr. Cartwrightâs case, his merits, and the extent
to which the country was then profiting by his discoveries, had become,
by 1807, so manifest to those who were best acquainted with
the cotton trade, that a considerable number of the most respectable and
influential gentlemen of Manchester presented a memorial to government,
praying that some remuneration for his useful inventions might
be taken into consideration. He petitioned the legislature himself to
the same effect; and in 1809 obtained from parliament a grant of
Â£10,000 for âthe good service he had rendered the public by his
invention of weaving.â The compensation thus awarded, though
falling far short of the sums he had expended in perfecting his inventions,
as well as in defending his patent-rights, contributed essentially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>to place him in comparatively easy circumstances; and being advanced
in life, he was thankful to be enabled to pass the remainder of his days
in tranquil retirement. The activity of his mind however was unabated.
Engaged to the last in scientific pursuits, with an occasional revival of
the poetic spirit of his youth, he closed his active, useful, and benevolent
life at Hastings, October 30, 1823, in the eighty-first year of his age.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like many inventors, Dr. Cartwright was negligent of his pecuniary
interests: he possessed another quality less common to that
class of persons, entire freedom from jealousy, and great liberality in
communicating his ideas and assistance to others engaged in pursuits
similar to his own. And we may fairly conjecture that the temper
of mind in which such conduct originated, promoted his happiness
much more than any increase to his fortune, procured by a less frank
and generous spirit, could have done. It is also stated, that whether
from absorption in the pursuits of the moment, or carelessness of their
value, he was remarkably apt to forget his own productions, even
when offered to his notice. Among other instances of this disposition,
it is related, that on examining the model of one of his own machines,
he expressed great admiration, and said that he should have been
proud to have been the inventor of it; nor could he readily be convinced
that the merit was indeed his own.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this sketch of Dr. Cartwrightâs life a limited notice only has
been taken of his productions. He is chiefly known as the inventor of
the power-loom; but the public are also reaping the advantage
of several minor improvements in the arts of life, which emanated
from his active and observing mind. It is sufficient here to state that
he obtained ten patents, either for original inventions, or improvements
upon his earlier mechanical attempts: and in addition to the
kindred arts of weaving, spinning, wool-combing, and rope-making,
he had successfully applied his talents to a variety of subjects unconnected
with those manufactures.</p>

<p class='c000'>An account of his life, containing a more detailed description of his
various inventions, as well as a relation of the struggles and difficulties
which he encountered, is now, we are informed, in preparation for the
press. The portrait from which our engraving is taken was copied
from one painted by Robert Fulton, when studying the art under his
countryman, Benjamin West.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is perhaps not easy to invest the memoirs of a verbal critic with
the interest which attaches itself to the lives of men distinguished in
other departments of literature and science: the classical scholar has
little sympathy, in respect of his peculiar vocation, with the world
around him, and the world for the most part repays his indifference
with interest. Nevertheless, it is due to the great reputation of the
subject of this memoir to relate the principal events of his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Richard Porson was born December 25, 1759. His father, Mr.
Huggin Porson, was the parish-clerk of East Ruston, near North
Walsham, in the county of Norfolk. Notwithstanding his poverty,
Porson had the good fortune to obtain a first-rate education. Even
in his childhood he was taught by a careful father more than is generally
learned by the children of the rich; and after he had spent
a short time at a village school, to which he was sent at the age of
nine, his abilities attracted the notice of Mr. Hewitt, the vicar of his
native place, who kindly undertook to teach the young prodigy the
rudiments of Greek and Latin. In these elementary studies Porson
passed his time till 1774, being also occasionally employed as a shepherd
or a weaver. But his reputation had reached the ears of Mr.
Norris, of Grosvenor Place, who in the summer of that year undertook
the charge of maintaining him at Eton College. His name soon
became favorably known beyond the circle of his admiring school-fellows.
The interest which he excited was fortunate for him, for on the
death of his kind patron Mr. Norris, he would have been unable to
continue at Eton, had it not been for a subscription collected by Sir
George Baker, then President of the Royal College of Physicians, from
a number of gentlemen who had heard of Porsonâs talents, and were
desirous of giving him a fair opportunity to cultivate them to the uttermost.
With this subscription, an annuity of 80<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> for a few years was
purchased for him; and thus he was enabled to finish his course at
Eton, and to proceed thence to Trinity College, Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the second term of his third year (1781), Porson obtained one of
the Craven University Scholarships, which, being open to the free
competition of the whole body of undergraduates, have always been
regarded among our most honourable academical distinctions. He
took the degree of B. A. in 1782; and, on the mathematical tripos,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>obtained the respectable place of third senior optime: but he gained
the first of the medals annually given by the Chancellor of the University
to the two commencing bachelors of arts, under certain restrictions,
who pass the best examination in classical learning. In the
following September he was elected Fellow of Trinity College. He
proceeded to the degree of M.A. in 1785; but being unwilling, from
conscientious motives, to subscribe to the articles of the Established
Church, he could not take orders, and, according to the rules of the
College, vacated his Fellowship in 1791. He was thus for the second
time dependant upon the liberality of his friends. Nor did they neglect
him: a subscription was entered into by Mr. Cracherode and
some others, from the proceeds of which a life annuity of 100<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> was
purchased for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1792 he was elected Regius Professor of Greek: but, as the
salary of this office is only 40<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> per annum, he was still a poor man;
and not being able to procure a suitable lecture room, he was prevented
from making the usual addition to his income, by delivering lectures
on the Greek authors. In 1795 he married Mrs. Lunan, the sister of
Mr. Perry, the well-known Editor of the Morning Chronicle. From
this union, short as it proved, Porson derived important benefits. He
laid aside, while it lasted, most of the unseemly and intemperate habits
which he had contracted at College: but unfortunately his wife died
of consumption in 1797, and he subsequently relapsed into his former
course of life, and, as is too notorious, sacrificed friends, health and
fortune, to his passion for drinking. After her death the kindness of
his brother-in-law provided him with a home, gave him an opportunity
of mixing in good society, and preserved him from many inconveniences,
to which a man of Porsonâs careless habits is always exposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the time of his wifeâs death, in 1797, Porson published an
edition of the Hecuba of Euripides; which he intended to form the
first portion of a complete edition of that poet, and which, with very
modest pretensions, was at once acknowledged to be a piece of first-rate
criticism by the scholars not only of England but of all Europe.
However, in 1800, Gottfried Hermann of Leipzig, who has since
become very eminent as a verbal critic, published an edition of the
same play, as a professed attack on Porsonâs; and there was something
in the tone, as well as in the matter of his strictures, which more than
counterbalanced the compliment at the commencement of the preface.
When, therefore, Porson republished the âHecuba,â in 1802, he added
to the preface a long Supplement, in which Hermann was treated
rather superciliously; indeed it appears from a letter which Porson
wrote to Professor Dalzel, of Edinburgh, on the third of September,
1803, that he entertained a most sincere contempt for his German
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>censor. The Supplement, however, obtained the applause of the
learned in all countries, and, in its kind, it has rarely been surpassed
in learning and ingenuity. Porson subsequently published the
âOrestes,â âPhÅnissÃ¦,â and âMedea,â and the four plays, collected
into one volume, have gone through numerous editions.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the London Institution was established, in 1805, Porson
was appointed Librarian, with a salary of 200<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> per annum. The
situation however gave him no opportunity of useful exertion. He selected
indeed an excellent classical library, and was tolerably diligent
in his attendance; but he acquired in this monotonous employment a
habit of selfish intemperance, which impaired his faculties and ruined
his health. From the beginning of 1808 he was afflicted with asthma;
and neglecting the usual modes of treating this disease, he endeavoured
to cure it by abstinence. Under this regimen he grew weaker and
weaker, and on Monday, September 19, 1808, he was attacked with
apoplexy in the street. Being unknown, he was carried to a neighbouring
workhouse; but on the following day he was discovered and
taken home by his friends, whose attention had been called to an
advertisement describing his person, and some scraps of Greek writing
and algebra, which were found in his pockets. He recovered so far
as to receive a visit from his friend Dr. Adam Clarke, at the Institution;
but the hand of death was upon him, and he never regained the
full use of his faculties. He died on the night of the following Sunday,
just as the clock struck twelve. His body was conveyed to Cambridge,
and buried, with the highest academical honours, in Trinity College
Chapel, near the statue of Newton, where a monument, with a bust by
Chantrey, is erected to his memory.</p>

<p class='c000'>A complete list of Porsonâs works is given by Dr. Young in the
âSupplement to the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica.â The general reader
will perhaps form the best notion of his style from his celebrated
âLetters to Archdeacon Travis,â in which the genuineness of the
long-controverted text, 1 John v. 7, is, we may venture to say, finally
refuted. This work, from its subject, is chiefly interesting to the
theologian and scholar: but its wit, terseness and strength of style,
and force of argument, will well repay even the general reader for
perusing it. Of his posthumous works the Photius requires particular
notice. It was printed in 1822, from Porsonâs transcript of the
Galean MS. of an imperfect Lexicon, which is generally attributed to
the celebrated Patriarch of Constantinople. He had transcribed and
corrected this Lexicon with the intention of printing it some years
before his death, but a fire having broken out in Mr. Perryâs house
at Merton, and having consumed, among other papers, this transcript,
he began the task again, and completed another copy in his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>handwriting. A collection of his miscellaneous notes, under the title
of â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Adversaria</span>,â was published several years after the authorâs death.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Porson was the champion of English scholarship against the
attacks of continental critics, and the head of a school of verbal criticism
in this country, we must expect to find among his English
contemporaries and successors a sort of reverence for him not altogether
justified by his merits, and among the scholars of Germany, on
the other hand, a corresponding feeling of dislike and desire to disparage
him. Hermann wrote an article a few years since in the
âVienna Journal,â on the characteristics of English scholarship, in
which (vol. liv. p. 236,) the peculiar features of Porsonâs criticism
are said to be âgreat metrical accuracy in the kinds of verse with
which he was acquainted; in others, sometimes an acquiescent acceptance
of what he found, sometimes uncertain alterations: in his knowledge
of the Greek language, great correctness; a sound judgment in
the choice of readings, and considerate circumspection in conjecture,
except where his own rules came in the way.â On the other hand,
it is affirmed that âPorsonâs notes are defective in acute and decisive
proofs, and in that criticism which proceeds from a lively conception
of the poetical: and that their contents are much more indicative of
great industry and cool examination.â This is true enough as far as it
goes; but had Hermann in his old age forgotten the rivalry which
subsisted between Porson and himself in his earlier years, he would
not have omitted to add that, with all these drawbacks, Porson was the
greatest verbal critic of modern times.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been stated that Porson could not make himself generally
agreeable; but it is well known that he had a strong turn for the humorous,
and was almost always successful in his strokes of wit, so that
it cannot be doubted that his society was courted even by the superficial;
and we have heard from several of his surviving friends that,
though his coarseness was sometimes offensive, he was often a welcome
guest at the tea-table. He was also very happy in connecting classical
allusions with ludicrous associations; and Professor Dobree, in
his inaugural PrÃ¦lection, speaks rapturously of the delight which
Porsonâs broad vernacular translations from Aristophanes afforded to
his intimates at college. Some of his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeux dâesprit</span> have been printed
in the Classical Journal; the poem called âThe Devilâs Walkâ was
till lately attributed to him: it is stated in the last edition of Coleridgeâs
works to be the joint production of that poet and of Southey.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be necessary to say a few words in conclusion on those
two peculiarities for which perhaps Porson is most talked about at the
present day: his extraordinary memory, and his fondness for the
manual labour of writing. The former he attributed in great measure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>to the latter. He told a friend, that he recollected nothing which
he had not transcribed three times, or read at least six times;
adding the assurance, that any one who would take the same trouble
would acquire the same powers. We should incline to ascribe the
tenacity of his recollection, so far as it depended on cultivation, in
great measure to the early training of his father, who taught him the
rules of arithmetic without the use of book or pencil; and his proficiency
was such, that at nine years of age he is said to have been
able to extract cube roots in his head. His memory was as indiscriminate
as it was retentive and capacious. Proper names of no
importance, foolish ballads, and prosing tales he could recall as easily,
and repeat as accurately, as the passages of ancient authors which he
required for the illustration or correction of a line of Euripides: he
loved to recite, and was equally ready to repeat, âJack the Giant
Killer,â or half a book of Milton, to his wearied company. As to his
penmanship, it has been objected to him that he wasted many hours
in an employment which would have better suited a country writing-master
than a man of such talents. But it must be recollected that
a reader of Greek MSS. must also be a scribe himself; and a great
deal of the facility with which Porson performed his collations is to
be attributed to his practice as a calligrapher. And if, as he used
to say, his memory was principally formed by repeated copying, he
certainly did not throw away his time; for all that he did in the way
of illustrating Greek authors was mainly owing to his memory. And
the world has at least derived one benefit from the perfection of
Porsonâs handwriting, in the adoption by the English University
presses of a set of uniform types, formed after his models, of which
even Hermann has said that they far exceed all attempts made in
modern times to improve the beauty of Greek writing.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>WICLIF.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The village of Wiclif, distant about six miles from Richmond in
Yorkshire, had long been the residence of a family of the same name,
when it gave birth, about the year 1324, to its most distinguished
native. The family possessed wealth and consequence; and though
the name of the Reformer is not to be found in the extant records of
the household, it is probable that he belonged to it. Perhaps the
spirit of the times, and zeal for the established hierarchy, may have
led it to disclaim the only person who has saved its name from
absolute obscurity.</p>

<p class='c000'>John Wiclif was first admitted at Queenâs College, Oxford, but
speedily removed to Merton, a society more ancient and distinguished,
and adorned by names of great ecclesiastical eminence. Here he
engaged in the prescribed studies with diligence and success. In
scholastic learning he made such great proficiency as to extort admiration
from some who loved him not; and the direction in which his
talents were turned is indicated by the honourable appellation, which
he early acquired, of the Evangelic or Gospel Doctor. The terms,
âprofound,â âperspicuous,â âirrefragable,â were applied to mark
the respective peculiarities of Bradwardine, of Burley, and of Hales;
and so we may infer, that the peculiar bent of Wiclifâs youthful exertions
was towards the book on which his subsequent principles were
founded, and that he applied the ambiguous fruits of a scholastic education,
not to enlarge the resources of sophistry, but to illustrate the
treasures of truth. And on the other hand, in the illustration of those
oracles, and in the accomplishment of his other holy purposes, it was
of good and useful service to him that he had armed himself with the
weapons of the age, and could contend with the most redoubtable
adversaries on the only ground of argument which was at all accessible
to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1356 he put forth a tract on âThe Last Age of the Church,â
which was the first of his publications, and is on other accounts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>worthy of mention. It would appear that his mind had been deeply
affected by meditation on the various evils which at that period
afflicted the world, especially the pestilence which had laid waste, a
few years before, so large a portion of it. He was disposed to ascribe
them to Godâs indignation at the sinfulness of man; and he also
believed them to be mysterious announcements of the approaching
consummation of all things. Through too much study of the book
of the Abbot Joachim, he was infected with the spirit of prophecy;
and, not contented to lament past and present visitations, he ventured
to predict others which were yet to come. All however
were to be included in the fourteenth century, which was to be the
last of the world. That Wiclif should have been thus carried away
by the prevalent infatuation, so as to contribute his portion to the
mass of vain and visionary absurdity, was human and pardonable: but
in his manner of treating even this subject, we discover the spirit and
the principles of the Reformer. Among the causes of those fearful
calamities, among the vices which had awakened to so much fierceness
the wrath of the Almighty, he feared not to give the foremost
place to the vices of the clergy, the rapacity which <em>ate up the people
as it were bread</em>, the sensuality which infected the earth with its savour,
and âsmelt to heaven.â Here was the leaven which perverted and
corrupted the community; here the impure source whence future visitations
should proceed. âBoth vengeance of sword, and mischiefs
unknown before, by which men in those days shall be punished, shall
befal them, because of the sins of their priests.â Thus it was that
in this singular work, of which the foundation may have been laid
in superstition, Wiclif developed notwithstanding a free and unprejudiced
mind, and one which dared to avow without compromise,
what it felt with force and truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mendicant orders of friars were introduced into England in
the year 1221; and they presently supplanted the antient establishments
in the veneration of the people, and usurped many of the prerogatives,
honours, and profits of the sacerdotal office. As long as
they retained their original character, and practised, to any great extent,
the rigid morality and discipline which they professed, so long
did their influence continue without diminution, and the clamours of
the monks and the priests assailed them in vain: but prosperity soon
relaxed their zeal and soiled their purity, and within a century from
the time of their institution, they became liable to charges as serious
as those which had reduced the authority of their rivals. Accordingly,
towards the middle of the following century, the contest was conducted
with greater success on the part of the original orders; and some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>the leading prelates of the day took part in it against the Mendicants.
Oxford was naturally the field for the closest struggle, and the rising
talents of Wiclif were warmly engaged in it. About the year 1360
he is generally believed to have first proclaimed his hostility âagainst
the orders of friars;â and he persisted, to the end of life, in pursuing
them with the keenest argument and the bitterest invective, denouncing
them as the authors of âperturbation in Christiandome, and
of all the evils of this worlde; and these errors shallen never be amended
till the friars be brought to freedom of the Gospel and clean religion
of Jesu Christ.â</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1365 Urban V. renewed the papal claim of sovereignty
over the realm of England, which was founded on the submission
rendered by John to Innocent III. The claim was resisted by
Edward III., and the decision of his parliament confirmed, in the
strongest language, the resolution of the monarch. A zealous advocate
of papacy ventured to vindicate the pretension of the Vatican,
and challenged Wiclif to reply to his arguments. He did so; and
his reply has survived the work which gave it birth. It is not however
remarkable for any power of composition, still less can it be
praised for grace or accuracy of style; but it stands as a rude
monument of his principles, and proves that even then he was imbued
with that anti-papal spirit which more splendidly distinguished his
later years. Still, he was not yet committed as the adversary of
Rome; and in a dispute, in which he was engaged with the Archbishop
of Canterbury at this very time, he appealed from the decision
of the Primate to the authority of the Pope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seven years afterwards, at the age of forty-eight, Wiclif was raised
to the Theological Chair at Oxford; and from this period we may
date the most memorable of his spiritual achievements. For it is a
question whether, had he died before that time, his name would have
come down to us distinguished by any peculiar characteristic from
those of the other divines and doctors of his age; but when he turned
this eminence into a vantage-ground for assailing the corruptions
of his church, and thus recommended the expressions of truth and
justice by the authority of academical dignity, his language acquired
a commanding weight, and his person a peculiar distinction, which
the former would never have possessed had he remained in an inferior
station, nor the latter, had he not employed his station for the noblest
purposes: purposes which, though they were closely connected with
the welfare and stability of the Roman Catholic communion, were
seldom advocated from the pulpits of her hierarchy, or the chairs of
her professors. Had Wiclif been no more than an eminent and dignified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>theologian, he would have been admired, perhaps, and forgotten,
like so many others. Had he been only a humble pleader for the reformation
of the church, his voice might never have been heard, or it
might have been extinguished by the hand of persecution: but his
rank removed him above the neglect of his contemporaries; and his
principles, thus acquiring immediate efficacy, have secured for him the
perpetual respect of a more enlightened and grateful posterity.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this time the various profitable devices, by which the Vatican
turned into its own channels the wealth and patronage of the church,
were come into full operation. By its provisions and reservations, and
other expedients, it had filled many valuable benefices with foreign
ecclesiastics; these, for the most part, were non-resident, and spent in
other countries the rich revenues which they derived from England.
This system had been vigorously opposed both by kings and people,
but with little effectual success; for the Pope commonly contrived to
repair the losses which he had sustained in the tempest during
the interval which succeeded it. In 1374 Edward III. dispatched an
embassy to Avignon to remonstrate on these subjects with Gregory XI.,
and procure the relinquishment of his pretensions. The Bishop
of Bangor was at the head of this commission, and the name of Wiclif
stood second on the list. The negociation was protracted, and ended
in no important result; and the various arts of the Vatican triumphed
over the zeal of the Reformer, and, as some believe, over the honesty
of the Bishop. Howbeit, Wiclif obtained on that occasion a nearer
insight into the pontifical machinery, and beheld with closer eyes the
secret springs which moved it. And if he carried along with him into
the presence of the vicar of Christ no very obsequious regard for his
person, or reverence for his authority, he returned from that mission
armed with more decided principles, and inflamed with a more determined
animosity. At the same time his sovereign rewarded his
services at the Papal Court by the prebend of Aust, in the Collegiate
Church of Westbury, in the diocese of Worcester; and soon afterwards
by the rectory of Lutterworth, in Leicestershire.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this period, his anti-papal opinions were more boldly declared,
and he became more and more distinguished as an advocate
for the Reformation of the Church. The suspicions of the hierarchy
were aroused; and whatever reasons the Prelates might have had
for sometimes siding with their sovereign against the usurpations of
the Pope, they were ill-disposed to listen to the generous remonstrances
of a private Reformer. Accordingly, at a Convocation held Feb. 3,
1377, they summoned him to appear at St. Paulâs, to clear himself
from the fatal charge of holding erroneous doctrines. Had Wiclif
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>trusted to no other support than the holiness of his causeâhad he
thrown himself, like Huss and Jerome of Prague, only on the mercy
and justice of his ecclesiastical judgesâit might have fared as ill
with him as it did with his Bohemian disciples. But his principles,
recommended as it would seem by some private intercourse, had
secured him the patronage of the celebrated John of Gaunt, Duke
of Lancaster, under whose protection he presented himself on the
appointed day before the assembled bishops. A tumultuous scene
ensued: and after an undignified and indecent dispute between the
Duke and the Bishop of London, the meeting dispersed without
arriving at any conclusion, or even entering on any inquiry respecting
the matter concerning which it was convened. The process against
Wiclif was however suspended; and this good result was at least
obtained, though by means more in accordance with the violent habits
of the age, than with the holiness of his cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the course of the same year, while the Pope was endeavouring
to re-establish and perpetuate his dominion in fiscal matters over
the English, and the Parliament struggling to throw it off altogether,
Wiclif was again called forth as the advocate of national independence;
and he argued with great force and boldness against the legality of the
papal exactions. In this Treatise, he entered more generally into the
question, as to what were the real foundations, not only of papal but
of spiritual pretensions; he pressed the Gospel of Christ as the last
appeal in all reasonings respecting the Church of Christ; and he contrasted
the worldliness and rapacity of his Vicar with the principles of
the religion, and the character of its Divine founder. The name and
example of Christ were never very pleasing objects of reflection to the
hierarchy of that age; and the argument with which they loved to repel
such ungrateful suggestions was, the personal oppression of those
who ventured to advance them. Accordingly, the storm gathered;
and four Bulls were issued forthwith against the doctrines and person
of Wiclif. âHis holiness had been informed that John Wiclif, rector
of the church of Lutterworth, and Professor of the Sacred Page, had
broken forth into a detestable insanity, and had dared to assert opinions
utterly subversive of the Church, and savouring of the perversity and
ignorance of Marsilius of Padua, and John of Ganduno, both of accursed
memory.â It was then ordained that he should be apprehended and
imprisoned; and in an address to Edward III., the arm of the flesh was
invoked to co-operate with the spiritual authorities for the suppression
of this monstrous evil. One of these Bulls was addressed to the University
of Oxford; and what may seem singular, it found there a
spirit so far in advance of the bigotry of the age, that a question was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>raised whether it should be received, or indignantly rejected. After
long hesitation, it was received; but still no readiness was shown to
comply with its requisitions, nor were any measures taken to punish or
degrade the Reformer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Howbeit, in the beginning of the year following, Wiclif presented
himself at Lambeth, before the Tribunal of the Papal Commissioners,
to meet the various charges of heretical pravity. We have no room
to doubt the wishes and intentions of his judges. But on this occasion
he was rescued from them, for the second time, by extraneous
circumstances. The populace of London, among whom his opinions
may have made some progress, and by whom his name was
certainly respected, interrupted the meeting with much clamour and
violence, and showed a fierce determination to save him from oppression.
And at the same time, while the delegates were confounded by
this interference, a message was delivered to them from the Queen
Mother, prohibiting any definitive sentence against Wiclif. Thus
unexpectedly assailed, and from such different quarters, the Prelates
immediately softened their expressions, and abandoned their design;
and Wiclif returned once more in safety to the propagation of his
former opinions, and to the expression of others which had not yet
been broached by him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sum of those opinions might be given with tolerable accuracy,
though some of them were not perhaps propounded with perfect distinctness,
and others have been made liable to consequences which
were disclaimed by their author. In the first place, he rejected every
sort of pretension, tenet, or authority, which did not rest on the foundation
of Scripture: here he professed to fix the single basis of his
whole system. Accordingly he denounced, with various degrees of
severity, many of the popular observances of his church. He rejected
auricular confession; and declared pardons and indulgences to be no
better than antichristian devices for augmenting the power and wealth
of the clergy, at the expense of the morality of the people. He paid
no respect to excommunications and interdicts; he pronounced confirmation
to be an unnecessary ceremony, invented for the aggrandizement
of the episcopal dignity; he reprobated the celibacy of
the clergy, and the imposition of monastic vows. And in his contempt
for the outward ceremonies of the church, even to the use
of Sacred music, he anticipated by more than two centuries the
principles of the Puritans. In like manner, he maintained that bishops
and priests, being one and the same order according to their original
institution, were improperly distinguished; and that the property
claimed by the clergy, being in its origin eleemosynary, was merely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>enjoyed by them in trust for the benefit of the people, and was disposable
at the discretion of the secular government.</p>

<p class='c000'>So long as Wiclif confined himself to the expression of these opinions,
though he ensured the hatred of the hierarchy, he might reckon
on a powerful party both at the Court and among the people. The
objects for which he contended were at least manifest, and his arguments
generally intelligible. But he was not content with this limited
field. In his solicitude to assail all the holds of papacy, and denounce
all its pernicious errors, he entered, in the year 1381, into a controversy
respecting the nature of the Eucharist. His opinion on this mysterious
question seems to have approached very nearly to that of Luther.
He admitted a real presence; but though he did not presume to determine
the manner, he rejected the doctrine of Transubstantiation in
the Roman Catholic sense. This was ground sufficient for a new
clamour, louder and more dangerous than all that had preceded it:
not that there was stronger argument on the side of his opponents, but
because the subject, being more obscure, was more involved in prejudice;
it was more closely connected with the religious feelings and
deepest impressions of his hearers; it affected, not their respect for a
sensual and avaricious hierarchy, but their faith in what they had been
taught to consider a vital doctrine essential to salvation. And thus
it proved, not perhaps that his enemies became more violent, but that
his friends began to waver in their support of him. The lower
classes, who had listened with delight to his anti-sacerdotal declamations,
trembled when he began to tread the consecrated ground of their
belief. His noble patrons, if they were not thus sensibly shocked, perceived
at least the impolicy of contending in that field; and John of
Lancaster especially commanded him to retire from it.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the sincerity of a zealot he persisted, and in the course of May,
1382, a Synod was held by Courtney, who had been just promoted to
the primacy, and the heresies of Wiclif became, for the third time, the
subject of ecclesiastical consultation. We have no space to pursue
the details of these proceedings. The result was, that he was summoned
to answer, before the Convocation at Oxford, respecting certain
erroneous doctrines, the most prominent of which was that regarding
the Eucharist. He prepared to defend them. And it was then that
the Duke of Lancaster, who had been his faithful protector throughout
all his previous troublesâwhether it was that he sincerely differed
with Wiclif on that particular question, or whether he was unwilling
to engage in a struggle with the whole hierarchy, supported by
much popular prejudice, for the sake of an abstract opinion, which
might appear to him entirely void of any practical advantageâwithdrew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>his support, and abandoned the Reformer to his own
resources. Yet not then was his resolution shaken. In two Confessions
of Faith, which he then produced, he asserted his adherence to
his expressed doctrines. And though one of them is so perplexed
with scholastic sophistry, as to have led some to imagine that it was
intended to convey a sort of retractation, yet it was not so interpreted
by his adversaries, six of whom immediately entered the lists against
it. Neither did it persuade his judges of his innocence. He was
condemnedâbut not, as the annals of that age would have led us to
expect, to death. And whether the praise of this moderation be due
to the Prelates who forbore so far to press their enmity, or to the
State, which might have refused to sanction the vengeance of the Prelates,
Wiclif was merely condemned to banishment from the University
of Oxford. He retired in peace to his rectory at Lutterworth, and
there spent the two remaining years of his life in the pursuit of his
theological studies and the discharge of his pastoral duties.</p>

<p class='c000'>The greater part of the opinions by which he was distinguished were
so entirely at variance with the principles and prejudices of his age,
that our wonder is not at their imperfect success, but at their escape
from immediate extinction. Having thus escaped, however, and taken
root in no inconsiderable portion of the community, they were such
as to secure by their own strength and boldness their own progress and
maturity. Neither was their author neglectful of the methods proper
to ensure their dissemination. For in the first place, by his translation
of the Sacred Book on which he supposed them to rest, he increased
the means of ascertaining their truth, or at least the spuriousness
of the system which they opposed. In the next, he sent forth
numerous missionaries, whom he called his âPoor Priests,â for the
express purpose of propagating his doctrines; and thus they acquired
some footing even in his own generation. In succeeding years,
the sect of Lollards, in a great measure composed of his disciples, professed
and perpetuated his tenets; and by their undeviating hostility
to the abuses of Rome, prepared the path for the Reformation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor were the fruits of his exertions confined to his native country.
It is certain that his works found their way, at a very early period,
into Bohemia, and kindled there the first sparks of resistance to the
established despotism. The venerable Huss proclaimed his adherence
to the principles, and his reverence for the person, of the English
Reformer; and he was wont in his public discourses to pray, that
âon his departure from this life, he might be received into those
regions whither the soul of Wiclif had gone; since he doubted not
that he was a good and holy man, and worthy of a heavenly habitation.â
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>The memory of Huss is associated by another incident with
that of his master. The same savage Council which consigned the
former to the flames, offered to the other that empty insult, which we
may receive as an expression of malignant regret that he had been
permitted to die in peace. It published an edict, âThat the bones
and body of Wiclif should be taken from the ground, and thrown far
away from the burial of any church.â After a long interval of hesitation,
this edict was obeyed. Thirty years after his death, his grave
was violated, and his ashes contemptuously cast into a neighbouring
brook. On this indignity, Fuller makes the following memorable
reflection:ââThe brook did convey his ashes in Avon; Avon into
Severn; Severn into the narrow seas; they into the main ocean. And
thus the ashes of Wiclif are the emblems of his doctrine, which now
is dispersed all the world over.â</p>

<p class='c000'>The date of Wiclifâs death renders the authenticity of his portraits
in some degree uncertain, and we are not able to trace the history of
any which exist. But that some memorials were preserved in his
features, in illuminations or otherwise, we may conclude from the
general resemblance which is to be traced in two different pictures of
himâthat from which our print is engraved, and that at Kingâs College,
Cambridge, engraved in âRoltâs Lives of the Reformers,â and
Verheiden, âPrÃ¦stantium Theologorum Effigies, &amp;c.,â 1602.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps no great revolution has ever been effected by means apparently
so inadequate to the end proposed, as in the first establishment
of the Spanish monarchy on the continent of America. The immense
importance of that revolution, and its intimate connexion with the
history of geographical discovery, warrant us in assigning a place in
our Gallery to a representative of the rude and daring men by whom
the mighty conquest was effected. Of these, Fernando Cortez claims
the first place. It is proper to mention, in explanation of what might
seem a capital omission in our work, that no authentic likeness is
known to exist of Columbus: a man raised above those who followed
him across the Atlantic, no less by the purity of his motives, than by
the originality of his daring career.</p>

<p class='c000'>Columbus, however, did not colonize the American continent: his
settlement was in Hispaniola. But the Spaniards soon took possession
of other islands in the group of the Antilles. In 1511 Diego
Velasquez annexed the most important of them, Cuba, to the Spanish
crown, and was rewarded with the appointment of Governor. Eager
to gain fresh wealth and honour, he equipped a squadron of discovery,
in 1518, which tracked the southern shores of the Gulf of Mexico,
and brought home so inviting a report, that he determined to attempt
the conquest of the country. But he was greatly embarrassed in the
choice of a commanding officer. To conduct the enterprise himself
was no part of his scheme: at the same time he was very desirous to
appropriate to himself the advantages likely to accrue from its successful
issue. It was no easy matter to find a person qualified by
talent and courage to assume the command of such an enterprise;
yet so humble in rank, or so devoid of ambition, as to give no umbrage
to the governorâs jealousy. After much hesitation, he invested
Cortez with the chief command as his lieutenant. The early history
and character of this remarkable man are clearly and concisely told
by Dr. Robertson.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>âHe was born at Medelin, a small town in Estremadura, in the
year 1485, and descended from a family of noble blood, but of very
moderate fortune. Being originally destined by his parents to the
study of the law, as the most likely method of bettering his condition,
he was sent early to the university of Salamanca, where he imbibed
some tincture of learning. But he was soon disgusted with an academic
life, which did not suit his ardent and restless genius, and
retired to Medelin, where he gave himself up entirely to active sports
and martial exercises. At this period of life he was so impetuous,
so overbearing, and so dissipated, that his father was glad to comply
with his inclination, and send him abroad as an adventurer in arms.
There were in that age two conspicuous theatres on which such of
the Spanish youth as courted military glory might display their
valour: one in Italy, under the command of the Great Captain; the
other in the New World. Cortez preferred the former, but was prevented
by indisposition from embarking with a reinforcement of troops
sent to Naples. Upon this disappointment he turned his views towards
America, whither he was allured by the prospect of the advantages
which he might derive from the patronage of Ovando, the Governor
of Hispaniola, who was his kinsman. When he landed at St.
Domingo, in 1504, his reception was such as equalled his most sanguine
hopes, and he was employed by the Governor in several honourable
and lucrative stations. These, however, did not satisfy his
ambition; and in the year 1511 he obtained permission to accompany
Diego Velasquez in his expedition to Cuba. In this service he distinguished
himself so much, that, notwithstanding some violent contests
with Velasquez, occasioned by some trivial events, unworthy of
remembrance, he was at length taken into favour, and received an
ample concession of lands and of Indians, the recompense usually
bestowed upon adventurers in the New World.</p>

<p class='c000'>âThough Cortez had not hitherto acted in high command, he had
displayed such qualities in several scenes of difficulty and danger, as
raised universal expectation, and turned the eyes of his countrymen
towards him, as one capable of performing great things. The turbulence
of youth, as soon as he found objects and occupations suited to
the ardour of his mind, gradually subsided, and settled into a habit of
regular indefatigable activity. The impetuosity of his temper, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>he came to act with his equals, insensibly abated, by being kept under
restraint, and mellowed into a cordial soldierly frankness. These
qualities were accompanied with calm prudence in concerting his
schemes, with persevering vigour in executing them, and with what
is peculiar to superior genius, the art of gaining the confidence and
governing the minds of men. To all which were added the inferior
accomplishments that strike the vulgar, and command their respect;
a graceful person, a winning aspect, extraordinary address in martial
exercises, and a constitution of such vigour as to be capable of enduring
any fatigue.</p>

<p class='c000'>âAs soon as Cortez was mentioned to Velasquez by his confidants,
he flattered himself that he had at length found what he had hitherto
sought in vain, a man with talents for command, but not an object for
jealousy. Neither the rank, nor the fortune of Cortez, as he imagined,
were such that he could aspire at independence. He had reason
to believe that by his own readiness to bury ancient animosities in
oblivion, as well as his liberality in conferring several recent favours,
he had already gained the good-will of Cortez; and hoped, by this
new and unexpected mark of confidence, that he might attach him
for ever to his interest.â</p>

<p class='c000'>It is remarkable that Velasquez, actuated by these views, should
have selected for his deputy such a man as is here described. He
soon repented of his confidence, and sought to revoke the commission
which he had bestowed. But Cortez, in addition to the funds
provided by the governor, had spent the whole of his own available
means in raising troops, and making preparations for the enterprise;
he was already embarked at the head of a body of impatient adventurers;
and he despised a mandate which there were no means of
enforcing. And one of his first steps after landing on the Main was
to throw off formally all subordination to Velasquez, and to assume
the title of Chief Justice and Captain General of the intended colony,
by virtue of a new commission, drawn in the kingâs name, and purporting
to continue in force until the royal pleasure should be known.</p>

<p class='c000'>The expedition sailed from Cuba, February 10, 1519, and following
the track of the preceding one, coasted the western side of the peninsula
of Yucatan. At St. Juan de Ulloa some natives came on board,
and replied to the questions put to them through the medium of
interpreters, that their country formed part of a great empire called
Mexico, governed by a powerful monarch, Montezuma. Several
interviews followed, in which Cortez, professing to come as ambassador
from his own sovereign, perseveringly demanded to be led into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>presence of Montezuma. This was peremptorily refused; but the
denial, as if to make amends, was accompanied by presents rich enough
to inflame, had that been necessary, the cupidity of the strangers.
Instead of departing, they laid the foundations of a settlement, named
Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz. Meanwhile, Montezuma acted indecisively
and weakly: he neither admitted his formidable visitors to
the friendly intercourse which they insidiously demanded, nor summoned
the strength of his empire to crush them at once; but let them
fortify themselves while he was making vain requisitions for their
immediate departure, and gave time and opportunity to those who
were discontented under his own heavy yoke, to rally round the
standard of the invader. And it was not long before the Spaniards
obtained that native assistance, without which their mere physical
strength must have sunk under the vastness of their enterprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cacique of Zempoalla, prompted by hatred of Montezuma, was
the first to assist in the ruin of his native land. Supported by a small
body of that chieftainâs troops, and attended by 200 Indians of an
inferior class, who in that country, where the art of breaking animals
to the use of man was unknown, performed the humiliating services of
beasts of burden, Cortez marched from Zempoalla towards the heart
of the country, August 16, with only 500 Europeans, and six cannon.
Aware that on the first reverse of fortune his men might grow disgusted
with an enterprise of such formidable appearance, or from
mere inconstancy might be eager to return to their homes in Cuba,
a temper which had been already manifested by some, he resolved,
before quitting the coast, to destroy the shipping; and it is a remarkable
instance of his ascendency over his followersâ minds, that he procured
a general consent to this decisive, not to say desperate measure,
which left small hope of safety but in success.</p>

<p class='c000'>His route lay through the country of the Tlascalans, a warlike
people, who spurned his professions of friendship, and attacked the
invaders in a series of battles. The imperfection of their weapons
rendered their efforts fruitless; and having been severely taught the
strength of their enemies, they sued for peace, and became faithful
and active allies. The Spaniards, accompanied by a body of 6000
Tlascalans, then advanced without resistance to Mexico itself; after
punishing an attempt to lead them into an ambuscade at Cholula
by an indiscriminate massacre, in which 6000 persons are reported
to have perished. Montezuma received them with the semblance
of profound respect. He told them of an ancient tradition, that the
ancestors of the Mexicans came originally from a remote region, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>conquered the land: after which their leader went back to his own
country, promising that at some future period his descendants should
return to reform their constitution, and assume the government; and
Montezuma expressed his belief that the Spaniards were the persons
whom his countrymen were thus taught to expect. Another tradition,
which helped to produce that weak and wavering conduct which
gave the Spaniards such advantage, foretold that some great misfortune
should accrue to the native inhabitants from a race of invaders
from the regions of the rising sun. It is remarkable that, according
to the earliest and best Spanish historians, this belief was very prevalent
in the New World.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Spaniards, with their Indian allies, were quartered in the
ample precincts of a royal palace. But Cortez was uneasy, notwithstanding
these fair appearances. He had advanced with a handful
of men into a populous city, where he might at any time be surrounded
and attacked by multitudes. He was warned by the Tlascalans of
Montezumaâs faithlessness; and the hostile spirit of the Mexicans was
made plain, by intelligence that several Spaniards had been slain in
repelling an attack on the garrison of Vera Cruz. Cortez felt that
Montezumaâs forbearance proceeded only from timidity, and that his
own best security lay in working upon that passion. He conceived
the daring resolution to make the king a prisoner in his own capital;
judging that, while Montezuma lived, the Mexicans would not throw
off their allegiance, nor disobey his mandates, though issued under
foreign control. He went, therefore, as usual, to the palace, attended
only by a few picked men; and being admitted without suspicion to
the emperorâs presence, he complained angrily of the attack on the
garrison of Vera Cruz, and required Montezuma, as a pledge of his
good faith, to take up his residence in the Spanish quarters. Betrayed
by his own easiness into the power of a few strangers, Montezuma
complied, under the imminent fear of personal violence. Cortez next
required that the officer who commanded in the attack complained
of should be given up. This was done; and he, his son, and five
others, were publicly burnt on a pile of Mexican weapons, taken
from the public armoury. While this atrocious act of cruelty and
revenge was proceeding, the emperor, apparently to render it the
more impressive, was placed in fetters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Haughty and tyrannical, but unstable and timid, the spirit of
Montezuma was entirely broken by his misfortunes. He remained
passively during six months in his captivity; and formally acknowledged
himself a vassal to the crown of Castile. Religion was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>only point on which he was firm. Cortez urged him with the blind
zeal of a crusader to renounce his false gods, and embrace Christianity;
and not content with these importunate solicitations, he attempted
forcibly to remove the idols from the grand temple. The
resolute interference of priests and people compelled him to desist
from the rash project; but not until it had aroused a spirit of implacable
hostility.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile Velasquezâs anger at Cortezâs faithlessness was increased
by the brilliant accounts of his success; and having obtained from
the court of Castile a patent constituting himself governor of New
Spain, he prepared to remove or punish his disobedient officer by
force of arms. He sent 900 men, commanded by Narvaez, a brave
and experienced officer, who immediately opened a correspondence
with Montezuma. This raised the hopes of the Mexicans, by showing
that their invaders were not exempt from internal discord. Cortez
perceived and met the dangers of his position with his usual ability
and courage. Having tried in vain to arrange matters with Narvaez
by negotiation, he left a garrison of 150 men in Mexico, and marched
with only 250 against an enemy who nearly quadrupled him in number.
His skill, the patience of his soldiers, inured to the inclemency
of a tropical climate, and the too great security of his adversary, won
for him an almost bloodless victory; and the troops sent out for his
destruction enlisted almost to a man under his standard. Placed
against all expectation at the head of near a thousand men, he hastened
back to Mexico, where by that time his presence was urgently
required.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found the Spanish garrison hemmed in, and reduced to extremities,
by a people who, stimulated by superstition and maddened by
a fresh and atrocious outrage, seemed suddenly to have exchanged
timidity for desperation. The return of Cortez with his formidable
reinforcement did not abate their ferocity. Even the person of Montezuma,
who was exposed on the Spanish rampart, ceased to command
respect, and he received three wounds from stones and arrows,
from the effects of which, aggravated by rage and a deep sense of his
degradation, he expired. The Mexicans now sought to blockade their
enemies and reduce them by hunger; and, as Cortez had not the command
of the lake, he found it necessary immediately to evacuate the
city. But he was taken at disadvantage in traversing by night (July
1, 1520) one of the long causeways which connect the city with the
shores of the lake in which it stands; and on mustering those who
reached the mainland, he found his small battalion of Europeans reduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>by one-half, with the loss of all the horses, baggage, artillery,
and most of the treasure which had been amassed by individual
soldiers. The anniversary of this calamity was long, and may be still,
distinguished in New Spain by the appellation of Noche Triste, the
sad night.</p>

<p class='c000'>By a circuitous route, and not without cutting their way through
an immense army assembled to intercept them, the Spaniards returned
to the friendly Indians of Tlascala, among whom Cortez meant to
recruit his exhausted companions, and to wait until fresh supplies of
men and stores could be obtained from the West India islands. Some
vessels which put into the harbour of Vera Cruz afforded an unexpected
reinforcement of 180 men; and on the 28th of December
Cortez began to retrace his march towards Mexico. At Tezeuco, the
second city of the empire, situated on the banks of the lake, about
twenty miles from the capital, he established his head-quarters for
four months, during which the timbers of twelve small vessels, cut out
in the mountains of Tlascala, were put together. This force ensured
the command of the lake, for the Mexicans had nothing larger than
canoes; and just before their completion, a reinforcement of 200
men, with arms and stores, arrived from Hispaniola. At the beginning
of May, 1521, with about 800 Europeans, Cortez commenced
the siege of Mexico itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Guatimozin, a nephew of Montezuma, who had succeeded to the
throne, made a resolute defence; and Cortez, aware of the danger of
entangling his troops in the streets, yet anxious to preserve the buildings
as a trophy of his victory, urged the siege with unusual caution.
Each day he pushed his way as far as possible into the city; but he
returned to his quarters at night, during which the barricades of the
causeways were repaired, and on the morrow a fresh battle was to be
fought on the same ground. Thus matters went until the 3d of July,
when Cortez, impatient of so protracted a resistance, made a desperate
attempt to carry every thing before him in one great assault. Experience
improved the Mexicans in the art of war. When the Spaniards, by
the energy of their attack, had forced a way into the heart of the city,
Guatimozin led them still onwards by a show of slackened resistance,
while he detached troops, by land and water, to beset the breaches in
the causeway by which it was necessary for the enemy to retire. At
a given signal, the great drum of the god of war was struck, and the
Mexicans returned to the attack, their hatred of the invaders stimulated
by the ferocity of their superstition. The Spaniards were compelled
to give way, and disorder was converted into absolute rout by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the promiscuous onset of the natives, when they arrived at the breach.
Above sixty Europeans perished, for those who were taken prisoners
were offered as sacrifices on the Mexican altars. After this reverse
Cortez took a surer way to success, and as fast as his troops made
a lodgment, he caused the houses to be levelled with the ground.
When three quarters of the city were thus destroyed, and those who
defended the remainder were exhausted by famine and disease, Guatimozin
yielded to the persuasion of those who urged him to preserve
himself, to renew the war in the remote provinces of the empire. But
he was intercepted and captured with his family, as he sought to
escape across the lake; and on the loss of their sovereign, the Mexicans
ceased to resist. The siege thus ended August 13, 1521.</p>

<p class='c000'>The victors were greatly disappointed in the amount of the precious
metals which fell into their hands. What remained of the royal
treasures Guatimozin had ordered to be thrown into the lake. Much
spoil was carried off by the Indian auxiliaries, and much probably
was lost or destroyed in the ruins of the city. The whole treasure
collected was inferior in amount to that which the Spaniards had
formerly received as a present from Montezuma; and the adventurers
clamorously expressed their dissatisfaction. Pressed by this spirit of
discontent, Cortez gave way to a passion, as alien to that undefined
feeling which we call the spirit of chivalry, as to the natural laws of
charity and justice; and tried, in vain, to extract by torture from the
royal prisoner and one of his favourite followers a discovery of the
treasures which were supposed to be hidden. Overcome by pain, the
latter cast a look on his master, which seemed to ask permission to
reveal what he knew. Guatimozin indignantly replied to the implied
entreatyââAm I reposing on a bed of flowers?â and the faithful
subject kept silence, and died. The emperor, with his two principal
officers, was afterwards hanged, on a groundless charge of having
excited insurrection.</p>

<p class='c000'>The provinces were readily overrun after the fall of the capital, and
made subject to Spain; though intolerable oppression often produced
insurrections, which were put down with unrelenting severity.
Having conquered an empire without commission from the monarch
in whose name he made war, Cortez narrowly escaped having to
answer as a criminal for the irregularity of his proceedings. But in
1522 he succeeded in procuring a royal commission, which constituted
him captain-general and governor of New Spain. Still his actions
were watched with an ungenerous though natural jealousy; and his
situation became so critical, that he resolved, in 1528, to return to Castile,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and answer, before no inferior tribunal, such charges as might
be urged against him. He appeared with the splendour which became
one who had unlocked the treasures of the New World; and
his own ample fortune, contrasted with the smallness of the sum divided
among his comrades, gave birth to a belief that he had not dealt
fairly in the partition of the spoil. As his return to Spain put an end
to all fears of his ambition, he was received with the favour which
such brilliant services merited. He was invested with the order of
St. Jago, the highest rank of Spanish knighthood; and the valley of
Guaxaca, with an extensive domain, was erected into a marquisate in
his behalf. But he could not obtain what he most desired, the supreme
direction of affairs in Mexico. He returned thither in 1530 at
the head of the military department, and with authority to prosecute
new discoveries; but the direction of civil affairs was vested in a
board, entitled the Audience of New Spain. Henceforward we may
regard Cortez as a disappointed and unhappy man. Thwarted at
home by the double authority established, he sought to reap new glory
by exploring the Pacific Ocean; and in 1536 he discovered the peninsula
of California, and surveyed part of the gulf which separates it
from the American continent. But from that country neither profit
nor honour, unless as a geographical discoverer, could be gained; and
the result of the expedition neither satisfied the expectations of others,
nor repaid the adventurers for the hardships which they underwent.
In 1540, wearied and disgusted, Cortez returned to Spain, and found
his services forgotten, or at least his person slighted. He served as a
volunteer in 1541, in Charles V.âs expedition against Algiers, and had
a horse killed under him. This was his last military action. After
wearying his proud spirit in fruitless attempts to gain attention from
Charles or his ministers to his real or supposed grievances, he retired
into seclusion, and died at Seville, December 2, 1547, in the sixty-third
year of his age.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have passed rapidly over the shocking cruelties which marked
the progress of the Spanish arms. Some portion of the horror, with
which we naturally regard the actors in such events, may be neutralized
by the consideration, that menâs notions in all things, and perhaps
most especially in matters of international justice, are greatly dependent
on the spirit of the time in which they live; and that it is
hardly fair to judge actions, which won the admiration of contemporaries,
according to the standard of a subsequent age. But even in
that age there were not wanting many to raise an indignant voice
against the cruelties practised on an unoffending people; and after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>every just allowance has been made, it is not to be doubted that the
treatment of the American aborigines forms a foul stain on the history
of Spain, and loads all who were concerned in it with an awful responsibility;
and we willingly acknowledge it to have been a just
retribution, that of the original settlers few reaped prosperity, repose,
or wealth, as the harvest of their arms. With their leaders it was
eminently otherwise. Scarce one of those who led the conquerors of
Peru escaped a violent death in civil strife; while Cortez (with whom
no one divides the fame of conquering Mexico) lived to experience the
proverbial ingratitude of courts, and died in that forced obscurity
which is most galling to an ambitious mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>The noble inscription, composed by Southey for the birth-place of
Cortezâs early companion in arms and rival in fame, needs but the
change of name to render it equally applicable to Cortez himself.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>LEIBNITZ.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The materials for this life of Leibnitz are chiefly taken from the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ã©loge</span></i>
of his contemporary Fontenelle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Godfrey William Leibnitz was born at Leipzic, June 23, 1646.
His father was Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of
that place: he died when his son was only six years old. Leibnitzâs
education therefore was left to his mother; and the great variety of
his studies is traced to his free access to a large collection of books
which his father left. He thus became a poet, an orator, an historian,
a lawyer, a metaphysician, a mathematician, and a theologian. In
some of these capacities he would not have escaped oblivion; but
every accession to such a mass of titles becomes interesting, when it
is remembered how conspicuous he became in more than one of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the age of twenty he applied to the University of Leipzic for the
degree of doctor of laws. This was refused, on the plea that he was
too young; and he then went to Altdorf, where he maintained a
public disputation, and was admitted to the degree which he desired,
with unusual distinction. From Altdorf he repaired to Nuremberg,
where he heard of a secret society of chemists, or, which was then the
same thing, of searchers after the philosopherâs stone. Desiring to
obtain some insight into their pursuits, he procured some books on
chemistry, a subject which he had never studied, and picking out the
phrases which seemed hardest, he wrote a letter altogether unintelligible
to himself, which he addressed to them as his certificate of
qualification. He was admitted with great honour, and was even
offered the post of secretary, with a salary; and though he continued
his intercourse with them for some time, he kept up his character as
an adept to the last.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>His first work, which appeared when he was twenty-two years old,
was a treatise written under the name of George Vlicorius, recommending
the choice of the Elector Palatine to be King of Poland.
In 1670 he published his first philosophical work, an edition of
âMarius Nizolius contra Pseudophilosophos;â and in the following
year two treatises on abstract and concrete motion, severally dedicated
to the French Academy and the Royal Society.</p>

<p class='c000'>During his abode at Nuremberg, the Baron de Boinebourg, minister
of the Elector of Mayence, procured a legal appointment for him in that
state. While he held this post he travelled into France and England.
After the death of the Elector, he accepted a similar appointment in
the dominions of the Duke of Brunswick-Lunenberg. At the peace
of Nimeguen in 1678 he wrote upon some disputed ceremonials, under
the title of Cesarinus Furstnerius, and displayed a great extent of
reading, and a little of that speculative spirit which afterwards produced
the <em>pre-established harmony</em>. He is said, though a Lutheran, to
have argued on the supposition that Europe was to be considered as a
large federation, of which the Emperor was the temporal, and the
Pope the spiritual, head. In 1679 he was engaged by the reigning
Duke to write the history of the House of Brunswick. On this service
he went through Germany and Italy in search of authorities. It is
related that, on one occasion, having left Venice in a small boat, a
storm arose, and the boatmen began to discuss in Italian, which they
supposed their passenger did not understand, the propriety of throwing
the heretic overboard. Leibnitz, with great presence of mind, drew
out a rosary, which he had about him <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par prÃ©caution</span></i>, as Fontenelle
supposes, who does not seem to guess that this anecdote, coupled with
what has preceded, makes it at least an even chance that Leibnitz was
really a Catholic. And this is negatively supported by the fact, that,
Lutheran as he was considered, he very rarely attended the services
of his church, in spite of the publicly-expressed disapprobation of
the clergy. But on the other hand, he positively refused to profess
Catholicism, when an advantageous settlement at Paris was offered on
that condition. That he was both a religious man and a Christian is
sufficiently attested by his writings.</p>

<p class='c000'>He returned from his tour in 1690, and in 1693 published his
â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Juris Gentium Diplomaticus</span>.â He had published almost at
the same time with his first work a treatise on the study of jurisprudence.
The first volume of the âHistory of Brunswickâ appeared
in 1707, and two others in 1710 and 1711.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1700 he induced the Elector of Brandenburg to found the Academy
of Berlin, of which he was appointed perpetual president. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>contributed many valuable papers to its memoirs. His patron, the
Duke of Brunswick-Lunenberg, died in 1678, and was succeeded by
Ernest-Augustus, first Elector of Hanover, on whose issue by the
Electress Sophia the crown of England was settled. Leibnitz continued
in the Electorâs service till his death. This took place from
gout, November 14, 1716, at Hanover. The real life of such a man
is in his character and writings. With regard to the first, the
account of Fontenelle is as follows. He had a strong constitution,
ate a good deal, drank little, and never undiluted liquors. When
alone, he always took his meals as his studies permitted. His chair
was frequently his only bed, and in this way he is said to have sometimes
passed whole months. He made notes of all he read, not to
preserve them, but to fix the contents on his memory; for when once
written, they were finally laid aside. He communicated freely with
all classes of men, and could entirely divest himself of his character of
a philosopher. His correspondence was immense; he answered every
one who wrote, however small the pretext for addressing him. He
was of a gay humour, easily excited to anger, and easily appeased. He
lived at great expense, but had preserved and hid two yearsâ amount of
his salary. The securing of this treasure gave him great uneasiness;
and upon this slight ground he has been charged with avarice. He
was never married: it is said that he contemplated such a connexion
at the age of fifty, but that the lady desired time to consider. âThis,â
says his biographer, âgave M. Leibnitz the same opportunity, and he
continued unmarried.â</p>

<p class='c000'>The number and variety of characters in which Leibnitz is known
will not permit us to say much upon each subject. His public life was
that of a jurist. His âHistory of Brunswickâ was continued by M.
Echard; who supplied Fontenelle with the necessary information for
his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ã©loge</span></i>. In youth he was a poet; and he is said in one day to
have made three hundred Latin verses without a single elision. But
the Leibnitz of our day is either the mathematician or the metaphysician.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first of these two characters he is coupled in the mind of the
reader with Newton, as the co-inventor of what was called by himself
the Differential Calculus, and by Newton the Method of Fluxions.
Much might be instanced which was done by him for the pure sciences
in other respects; but this one service, from its magnitude as a discovery,
and its notoriety as the cause of a great controversy, has
swallowed up all the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leibnitz was in London in 1673, and from that time began to pay
particular attention to mathematics. He was in correspondence with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Newton, Oldenburg, and others, on questions connected with <em>infinite
series</em>, and continued so more or less till 1684, when he published his
first ideas on the Differential Calculus in the Leipzic Acts. But it is
certain that Newton had been in possession of the same powers under
a different name, from about 1665. The English philosopher drops
various hints of his being in possession of a new method, but without
explaining what it was, except in one letter of 1672, of which it was
afterwards asserted that a copy had been forwarded to Leibnitz in
1676. Leibnitz published both on the Differential and Integral
Calculus before the appearance of Newtonâs Principia in 1687;
and indeed before 1711, the era of the dispute, this new calculus had
been so far extended by Leibnitz and the Bernoullis, that it began to
assume a shape something like that in which it exists at the present
day. In the first edition of the Principia, Newton expressly avows
that he had, ten years before (namely, about 1677), informed Leibnitz
that he had a method of drawing tangents, finding maxima and
minima, &amp;c.; and that Leibnitz had, in reply, actually communicated
his own method, and that he (Newton) found it only differed from his
own in symbols. This passage was, not very fairly, suppressed in the
third edition of the Principia, which appeared in 1726, alter the
dispute; and the space was filled up by an account of other matters.
It was obvious that, on the supposition of plagiarism, it only gave
Leibnitz a year to infer, from a hint or two, his method, notation,
and results.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some discussion about priority of invention led Dr. Keill to
maintain Newtonâs title to be considered the sole inventor of the
fluxional calculus. Leibnitz had asserted that he had been in
possession of the method eight years before he communicated it to
Newton. He appealed to the Royal Society, of which Newton was
President, and that body gave judgment on the question in 1712.
Their decision is now worth nothing; firstly, because it only determined
that Newton was the <em>first</em> inventor, which was not the whole
point, and left out the question whether Leibnitz had or had not
stolen from Newton; secondly, because the charge of plagiarism is
insinuated in the assertion that a copy of Newtonâs letter, as above
mentioned, had been sent to Leibnitz. Now they neither prove that
he had received this letter in time sufficient to enable him to communicate
with Newton as above described, or, if he had received it,
that there was in it a sufficient hint of the method of fluxions. The
decision of posterity is, that Leibnitz fairly invented his own method;
and though English writers give no strong opinion as to the fairness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>with which the dispute was carried on, we imagine that there are
few who would now defend the conduct of their predecessors. Whoever
may have had priority of invention, it is clear that to Leibnitz
and the Bernoullis belongs the principal part of the superstructure,
by aid of which their immediate successors were enabled to extend the
theory of Newton; and thus Leibnitz is placed in the highest rank
of mathematical inventors.</p>

<p class='c000'>The metaphysics of Leibnitz have now become a by-word. He
is pre-eminent, among modern philosophers, for his extraordinary
fancies. His monads, his pre-established harmony, and his best of all
possible worlds, are hardly caricatured in the well-known philosophical
novel of Voltaire. If any thinking monad should find that the pre-established
harmony between his soul and body would make the
former desire to see more of Leibnitz as a metaphysician, and the
latter able to second him, we can inform him that it was necessary,
for the best of all possible universes, that Michael Hansch should in
1728 publish the whole system at Frankfort and Leipzic, under the
title, â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leibnitzii Principia philosophica more geometrico demonstrata</span>;â
and also that M. Tenneman should give an account of this system,
and M. Victor Cousin translate the same. It is not easy to give any
short description of the contents, nor would it be useful. A school
of metaphysicians of the sect of Leibnitz continued to exist for some
time in Germany, but it has long been extinct.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mathematical works of Leibnitz were collected and published
at Geneva in 1768. His correspondence with John Bernoulli was
also published in 1745, at Lausanne and Geneva. It is an interesting
record, and exhibits him in an amiable light. He gives his friend a
check for his manner of speaking of Newton, at the time when the
partizans of the latter were attacking his own character, both as a man
and a discoverer. He says (vol. ii. p. 234), âI thank you for the animadversions
which you have sent me on Newtonâs works; I wish you
had time to examine the whole, which I know would not be unpleasant
even to himself. But in so beautiful a structure, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non ego paucis
offendar maculis</span></i>.â He also says that he has been informed by a
friend in England, that hatred of the Hanoverian connexion had something
to do with the bitterness with which he was assailed; â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non
ab omni veri specie abest, eos qui parum Domui HanoveranÃ¦ favent,
etiam me lacerare voluisse; nam amicus Anglus ad me scribit, videri
aliquibus non tam ut mathematicos et Societatis RegiÃ¦ Socios in
socium, sed ut <em>Toryos in Whigium</em> quosdam egisse.</span>â (Vol. ii. p. 321.)</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>XIMENES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Gonzales Ximenes de Cisneros, Primate and Regent of Spain,
was born at Tordelaguna, in Castile, in 1437. He was descended
of an ancient family, long settled at Cisneros in the kingdom of
Leon, and was baptized Gonzales after an ancestor who was one of
the most renowned knights of his day: the name of Francis, by
which he is commonly known, he assumed in after-life, in honour
of the saint whose monastic rule he embraced. But though he
was of honourable descent, neither rank nor wealth were stepping-stones
to his preferment. His father supported a large family upon
the income of his humble office of collector of tenths, payable to the
king by the clergy: but his own studious disposition, and the facilities
then afforded by the universities to poor scholars, raised him out
of the obscurity in which his lot appeared to be cast. At the schools
of Alcala, and at the University of Salamanca, he studied philosophy,
theology, canon and civil law; and his proficiency soon enabled him to
support himself, by teaching others. Having completed his education
he undertook a journey to Rome, hoping there to find a readier field
for the exercise of his talents than at home. Poor and friendless, he
maintained himself by pleading in the Spanish causes which came
before the Court of the Consistory; and he was already rising into
eminence, when, hearing of his fatherâs death, and the distress of his
family, he abandoned his flattering prospects and returned to Spain.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears that he had taken holy orders during his abode at
Rome, for before his departure Sixtus IV. bestowed on him a reversionary
grant of the first benefice which should fall vacant. This
proved to be Uceda; and he immediately produced his letters and
took possession. The Archbishop of Toledo, who had already promised
the living, was highly offended at this exercise of what in
truth was a most objectionable prerogative of the Holy See. He not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>only dispossessed, but imprisoned for six years, Ximenes, who remained
firm in the assertion of his rights. At the end of that time
the prelate yielded. Ximenes soon exchanged Uceda for a chaplaincy
in the cathedral of Siguenza. Here he applied himself to the
pursuit of theology, and laid the foundation of that Hebrew and
Chaldaic learning which bore such noble fruit in after-life. He
gained the warm friendship of his bishop, the Cardinal Mendoza,
who, in 1483, appointed him grand vicar of the diocese. In that
office he distinguished himself by integrity and talents for business,
as he had before by piety and learning. And the fairest prospect of
advancement was open to him, when all at once he resolved to quit
the world, and to devote himself wholly to religious meditation.</p>

<p class='c000'>He embraced the strictest rule of the Franciscan order, with a
zeal to which the general example of his brethren gave no countenance.
He retired to the secluded monasteries of Castagnar and
Salceda, and in the forests which surrounded them, devoted himself
wholly to prayer, the study of the Scriptures, and the mortification of
the flesh. He thus gained the reputation of uncommon sanctity, and
there seems to be no reason to think that his asceticism was defiled by
any trace of hypocrisy. But his friend the Cardinal saw that he was
fitted for still better things, and regretting his departure from active
life, expressed a belief that he would ultimately be raised to much
higher dignity, to the great advantage of the Church. And, in truth,
the Cardinal, who had been raised from the see of Siguenza to the
primacy of Spain, the Archbishopric of Toledo, did much to fulfil his
own prediction. He introduced Ximenes to the Queen Isabella,
who was then in want of a confessor, and she readily listened to
his recommendation, and appointed Ximenes to the vacant office.
He would fain have declined it, urging that he had been called
to the cloister from active life to attend to his own salvation; that
what was demanded would withdraw him from his proper vocation;
and that a sovereign above all persons needed a religious guide,
not only of good intentions, but of experience and wisdom. The
Queen smiled as she assured him, that if he had formerly been
directed to solitude, he was now summoned to court, and that if he
would take charge of her conscience, she would be answerable for
having chosen him to do so. And he consented, on condition that he
should be required to attend her only when called by the duties of
his office. This was in 1492. The austerity of his life and the
wildness of his aspect caused him, when he appeared, to be compared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>by the gay frequenters of the court to an old Egyptian hermit come
out from the desert.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moved by the hope of advancing the temporal interests of their
order, his monastic brethren now appointed him their provincial.
They widely mistook his character. He accepted the proffered dignity,
moved chiefly by the hope that it would furnish him with an
excuse for more frequent absence from court; and he employed his
power in striving to reform the corruptions which abundant wealth
had introduced among them. His own life was in strict adherence
to the self-denial which he recommended to others. In his visitations
he travelled on foot from convent to convent, accompanied by one
brother, Francis Ruyz, whom he had selected for his constant companion,
as uniting the qualifications of a lively temper and sound health,
with learning, modesty, and trustworthiness. For their sustenance
they depended upon alms, and in the trade of begging Ximenes was
very unsuccessful. Ruyz used to remonstrate on the misapplication of
his talents. âYour Reverence will let us die of hunger; you were
not meant for this profession. God gives each of us his talents: do
you pray for me, and I will beg for you. Your Reverence may be
made to give, but certainly not to ask.â Visiting Gibraltar in one of
these tours, he was strongly possessed by the desire of going to preach
the gospel in Africa. On this subject he consulted a female devotee,
who had the reputation of enjoying divine revelations in visions, and
was dissuaded by her from prosecuting the scheme.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Primate Mendoza died at the end of 1494. In their last interview,
he urged his sovereign not to entrust the vast revenues of his
see to any one connected with the highest nobility, esteeming its
power to be even dangerous to the crown, when knit by family ties
to great feudal influence. Isabella listened to his advice, and after
much hesitation pitched on Ximenes to be his successor. Aware of
his feelings, she kept her intentions secret until letters confirmatory
of the appointment arrived from the Pope. These without preface
she put into his hands. Reading the address, âTo our venerable
brother Ximenes, Archbishop elect of Toledo,â âMadam,â he said,
âthese letters are not for me;â and he rose abruptly and quitted the
royal presence. Six months elapsed before he was induced to accept
the proffered dignity, in virtue of a direct injunction from the Pope.
He was consecrated October 11, 1495.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rank and wealth made no difference in the manners of the ascetic
monk. He continued to live upon the coarsest fare, to wear the
humble dress of his order, to sleep on the ground, or on a bed as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>hard, and to travel on an ass, or on foot. And Pope Alexander VI.
thought it necessary to send a letter to him, with the very unusual exhortation
to cultivate the pomps and vanities of the world a little
more, for the sake of the church of which he was so exalted a member.
Ximenes obeyed, and probably became convinced of the propriety of
the counsel, as he became more engaged in civil government. He
assumed even a more gorgeous state than his predecessors, but he
still practised his usual self-denial in private; he slept and fared as
hardly as before, and wore a haircloth under his episcopal robes.
He was exemplary in the discharge of his public duties; liberal even
to an extreme in relieving the daily necessities of the poor, and in
contributing to charitable, useful, and religious undertakings; diligent
in promoting the welfare of the people to the full extent of his
almost regal power, by repressing extortion and peculation, whether
in courts of law, or the collection of the revenue, by providing for the
due administration of justice, ecclesiastical and civil, and by exercising
a strict superintendence over the conduct of the parochial
clergy. To the cry of the wretched his ears were always open; he
hated oppression; and if an injured vassal complained against the
highest noble in the land, he was ready to grant justice, if the matter
lay within his jurisdiction, or, if not, to carry the complaint before the
Queen. And his zeal and energy carried to a happy conclusion the
arduous undertaking of reforming the Franciscan brotherhood, upon
which he succeeded in enforcing a new system of regulations in 1499,
after a most obstinate resistance.</p>

<p class='c000'>We may here mention with unmixed praise one of the Archbishopâs
charitable undertakings. It was an institution for the education
of the daughters of indigent nobles, on such principles, according
to the words of our authority, as should train them to the fit
discharge of their duties towards their families and towards society.
A fund, afterwards increased by the Spanish monarchs, was set
apart to provide them with marriage portions. We may here trace
the original of the celebrated establishment of St. Cyr.</p>

<p class='c000'>His principal work was the establishment of a university at Alcala,
where he himself received his early education. The foundation-stone
was laid by himself in 1498; the buildings were completed,
and the first course of lectures given, in 1508. For a model he
took the university of Paris; he endowed it richly, and collected men
distinguished for their learning from all parts of Europe, to fill the
professorial chairs. Here he undertook the great work of publishing
the first Polyglot Bible, the Complutensian, as it is called, from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Latin name of Alcala, where it was printed, which will exist for ages
as a noble specimen of the Archbishopâs piety, munificence, and zeal
for learning. The four first volumes contain the Old Testament in
the Hebrewâthe Septuagint version, with a Latin translationâthe
Vulgate, as corrected by St. Jeromeâand the Chaldee Paraphrase,
with a Latin translation. The fifth and sixth volumes contain the
Greek Testament and the Vulgate. The printing of this great undertaking
commenced in 1502, and was not completed till 1517,
shortly before the death of Ximenes, who, when the last volume
was brought to him, is reported by his earliest biographer, after an
ejaculation of pious thanksgiving, to have addressed the bystanders in
these words:ââMany high and difficult undertakings I have carried
on in the service of the State, yet, my friends, there is nothing for
which I more deserve congratulation than for this edition of the
Scriptures, which lays open, in a time of much need, the fountain-head
of our holy religion, whence may be drawn a far purer strain of theology
than from the streams which have been turned off from it.â
But owing to a hesitation at the Court of Rome, how far the criticism
of the Scriptures should be encouraged, the Bible was not
given to the world till 1522. Only about 600 copies were printed.
The price fixed on it was six and a half ducats. The epistle dedicatory
to Leo X. is by Ximenes himself: the preface, according to Dr.
Dibdin, is by another hand. The most learned Hebrew and Greek
scholars who could be procured were employed in the collation of
manuscripts; and it may be noted that for seven Hebrew MSS.
the sum of 4000 golden crowns was paid. These with other treasures
of learning, which were deposited with the University of Alcala,
about the middle of the last century were sold to a firework-maker
as lumber. The whole cost of the work, which was defrayed by
Ximenes, is said to have exceeded 50,000 gold crowns.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1498 the Archbishop was summoned to Granada by Ferdinand
and Isabella, to deliberate on the means to be used for the conversion
of the Moors. Inflamed by zeal, he had recourse to means which
show the wisdom of the serpent more than the simplicity of the
dove. He began with the priests and doctors of the law, and strove
by kindness and attention, mixed with religious discussion, to dispose
them to adopt the Christian faith. The priests led over the people
in such flocks, that, in one day, the anniversary of which was observed
as a festival, December 18, 1499, upwards of 3000 persons were
baptized by aspersion in Granada. That the Archbishop should
have believed in the sincerity of these wholesale conversions is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>credible; he probably thought that a hypocritical worship of the true
God was a less evil than sincere idolatry. The inquisition was
charged with the superintendence of the souls of these nominal Christians,
and the relapse from that faith which they never embraced was
punished according to the mercy of that irresponsible tribunal. The
dread and indignation produced by these measures led to a revolt,
which was quelled, however, under the guidance of the Archbishop.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same desire of making Christians any how appears in the
measures adopted on this occasion. The inhabitants of the quarter in
which the tumult broke out were declared guilty of high treason, and
offered their choice of death or conversion. They embraced the latter;
and the other Granadans, to the number of 150,000, followed their
example. But these severities drove the most resolute spirits to that
last insurrection, related with so much interest in Washington Irvingâs
âChronicles of Granada;â which terminated in the expatriation of the
remnant who abided in their national creed. But however unapostolic
the Archbishopâs mode of conversion may have been, his zeal and ability
in instructing and rendering truly Christian those who submitted to
the outward forms of the religion is said to have been admirable.</p>

<p class='c000'>His conduct towards the unhappy natives of the West Indies was
less exceptionable. He did his utmost not only for their conversion,
but to protect them from the cruel exactions of the Spanish settlers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The excellent Isabella of Castile died November 26, 1504. According
to the tenor of his beloved mistressâs will, Ximenes steadily
maintained the claim of Ferdinand, her husband, to the regency of the
kingdom during the minority of Charles V. After the death of the
Archduke Philip, September 25, 1506, he renewed his exertions to
determine the Castilians in favour of Ferdinandâs claim to the regency,
in preference to the Emperor Maximilian, Charles V.âs paternal
grandfather; being satisfied that, notwithstanding the ancient jealousy
between Castile and Arragon, the former would be better governed
by a prince intimately acquainted with its circumstances and interests
than by a stranger. Ferdinand, who was then engaged at Naples,
owed his success in this matter to Ximenes; and showed his gratitude
by procuring for him the rank of Cardinal, with the title of
Cardinal of Spain, together with the office of Grand Inquisitor.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his zeal for spreading the true faith, Ximenes had conceived a
scheme for the conquest of the Holy Land, and indeed had nearly
succeeded in effecting a league for that purpose between Ferdinand,
Manuel of Portugal, and Henry VII. of England. But this hope
being defeated, he was still anxious to employ the power of Spain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>against Mahometanism, and used his best endeavours to persuade
Ferdinand to invade the coast of Barbary. The kingâs parsimony was
not to be overcome, until Ximenes offered a loan sufficient to equip
the proposed armament, and defray its expenses for two months; and
the capture of the town of Marsarquiver, in the autumn of 1505, was
the immediate result. Here the Spanish arms remained stationary till
1509, when the Cardinal obtained permission to attempt the siege of
Oran at his own expense, on the sole condition, that if he succeeded,
either the patrimony of the church expended in this secular undertaking
was to be repaid, or the domain conquered was to be annexed
to the see of Toledo. He assumed himself the supreme direction of
the expedition, entrusting the command of the army to Peter Navarre,
an able, turbulent, and ambitious soldier. Everything was unfavourable
to the Cardinal. The king was jealous of him; Navarre impatient
of the subjection of the sword to the crozier; and other officers,
corrupt or hostile, and encouraged by the example of their superiors,
stirred the soldiers to mutiny. But the decision of Ximenes compelled
obedience, and the wisdom of his measures ensured success; so that
the surrender of Oran was the almost immediate result of his descent
upon Africa. He would willingly have remained there to pursue his
successes. But finding the disobedience of his lieutenant to be secretly
encouraged by Ferdinand, he determined to return while he could do
so with honour, leaving Navarre in the command of the troops. For
himself or his see he reserved no part of the spoil. That which was
not bestowed upon the soldiers, or consumed in the service, he set
apart for the crown. Yet a fresh disagreement arose when the Cardinal,
according to the compact, demanded payment of the advances
made by the see; and when Ferdinand at last was compelled to
acquiesce, it was in the most ungracious and unbecoming manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ferdinand died January 23, 1516. On his death-bed he appointed
Ximenes Regent of Castile during the minority of Charles V., with
expressions indicative of no personal regard, but bearing strong
testimony to his unbending justice, disinterestedness, and zeal for the
public welfare. The Cardinalâs conduct in this exalted station was
consistent with the tenor of his past life; he was a just ruler, but his
authority was feared and respected rather than loved. If he had one
passion unmortified, it was ambition: he ruled with a single eye to
his young sovereignâs interests; but he evaded that sovereignâs attempts
to circumscribe his powers with as much success as he bore down
the opposition of those turbulent nobles, who hoped, in the weakness
of a minority, to find a fit opportunity for prosecuting their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>aggrandizement, and committing with impunity acts of illegal violence.
For when Charles V. sent some of his confidential Flemish ministers
to be associates in the commission of regency, the Cardinal received
them with respect, and granted them the external distinctions of office;
for the rest they were mere puppets in his hands. Of his internal
policy, the chief scope was to elevate the regal power, and to depress
that of the nobles, even by throwing a greater weight into the hands
of the unprivileged classes: the same policy as had been pursued by
the wisest princes of the age, Ferdinand and Isabella, Henry VII. of
England, and Louis XI. of France. The crown had been reduced
to great poverty by lavish grants, extorted, in disturbed times, by the
necessity of conciliating powerful noblemen, rather than granted by
free-will, or out of real gratitude for services; and it was one of
Ximenesâ first objects to remedy this evil, even by means which
showed none of that regard to vested interests, which belongs to times
in which the course of law is regular and supreme, and consequently
the rights of property are rigidly respected. Such pensions as had
been granted in Ferdinandâs reign he cut off at once, on the plea
that the grantor could only have bestowed them for his own life.
The crown lands alienated during the same period were resumed:
even the Cardinalâs boldness did not venture to carry the inquiry
farther back, from the apprehension of driving the whole body of the
nobility into revolt.</p>

<p class='c000'>These changes, and other important measures, were not carried into
effect without great discontent and considerable open resistance. But
the Cardinal was strong, in the resources of his own powerful mind, in
the general reverence of the people for the sanctity of his character, in
his exalted rank as head of the Spanish church, and in the immense
revenues of his see, which gave him a command of money not enjoyed
by the crown, and enabled him to keep in his own pay a considerable
body of troops. With these he maintained order, and repressed
feuds, which the barons, trusting to the common weakness of a
regency, hastened to decide by the sword; and set at defiance the
enmity of the nobility at a later period, when more decided encroachments
on the privileges of the order had produced a general spirit of
discontent. On one occasion a deputation of the chief grandees of
Castile required to be informed, under what title he presumed
to exercise such high authority. The Cardinal showed the will of
Ferdinand, and its confirmation by Charles V., and finding them
still unsatisfied, led them to a window, from which he pointed out a
strong military force under arms. âThese,â he said, âare the powers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>which I have received from the king. With these I govern Castile;
and with these I will govern it, until the king, your master and mine,
takes possession of his kingdom.â</p>

<p class='c000'>One of his schemes for strengthening the crown was the erection
of a species of militia, composed of burghers of cities; but that class
was not sufficiently advanced in knowledge to appreciate the immense
accession of importance which would accrue from this measure, which
they regarded solely as a burden. It was therefore unpopular among
them, as well as unpalatable to the barons; and was entirely dropped
soon after the regentâs death.</p>

<p class='c000'>His foreign policy was nearly confined to the conduct of two wars:
the one to maintain Navarre, which had been usurped by Ferdinand,
against the legitimate monarch John dâAlbret; the other, an expedition
against the pirate Barbarossa, King of Algiers, who inflicted a signal
and entire discomfiture on the invading army.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the administration of the kingdom Ximenes displayed the same
inflexible love of justice, and the same economy, integrity, and order,
as in the management of his own diocese of Toledo; and he brought
the finances into so flourishing a state, that after discharging the
crown debts, and placing the military establishment in a more than
commonly efficient state, he was enabled to remit large sums of money
to the young king in Flanders. And he had something of a title to
Charlesâs more immediate and personal gratitude, for having used with
success his own overpowering influence to obtain the recognition of
that prince as king of Castile during the lifetime of his insane mother,
against the usage of the realm, although he had remonstrated with
earnestness against pressing the indecorous and unfilial claim. All
these services however were thrown into the shade by one thing.
Ximenes hated the Flemish ministers whom Charles sent into Spain,
and who disgraced their high station, and corrupted the country by
open and abandoned venality. He never ceased to remonstrate against
these abuses, and to importune Charles to visit his Spanish dominions;
and the Flemish favourites saw that their own ruin was certain if the
regent once gained an ascendance over the kingâs mind. They retarded
therefore the departure of the latter as much as possible, and
succeeded in prejudicing him against his most sincere and judicious
friend and servant. Convinced at last of the necessity for his presence,
Charles set out for Spain, and landed in the province of Asturias,
September 13, 1517. The Cardinal hastened towards the coast to
meet him, but was stopped at Bos Equillos by a severe illness, which,
as was very usual in past times, was imputed to poison. He wrote to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>the king, entreating him to dismiss the train of foreigners by whom
he was attended, and earnestly soliciting a personal interview, which,
from the pressure of illness, he was unable himself to seek. This
favour was not granted, and he was vexed and harassed by a series of
petty slights. At the point of death he received a letter of dismissal
couched in civil but cold terms, permitting him to return to his diocese,
and repose from his labours. Whether the Cardinal retained his
faculties so as to be aware of this final mark of ingratitude is doubtful;
but his end was assuredly hastened by mortification at the evil return
made for his faithful service. He died a few hours after receiving the
dismissal in question, November 8, 1517.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though austere in temper, Ximenes was not cruel, and in civil
matters had great reluctance to the shedding of blood. Yet in eleven
years, as Grand Inquisitor, he burnt at the stake 2500 persons, for the
glory of God and the good of the suffererâs souls. Such miserable self-delusion
in so great and good a man ought to teach humility, as well
as to inspire abhorrence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our sketch has necessarily been personal rather than historical: a
fuller account of the public life of Ximenes will be found in Robertsonâs
âCharles V.,â as well as in the biographies of Flechier, Marsollier, and
others. Barrettâs âLife of Ximenesâ appears to be a compressed
translation from the Life by Flechier. We conclude with the short
and comprehensive praise of Leibnitz, who said, that âIf great men
could be bought, Spain would have cheaply purchased such a minister
by the sacrifice of one of her kingdoms.â</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ADDISON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Joseph Addison, the second of the six children of Dr. Launcelot
Addison and Jane Gulstone, was born May 1, 1672, at Milston in
Wiltshire. The feebleness of his infancy seems to have impaired his
spirit as a boy; for, in the General Dictionary, Dr. Birch relates, that
when at school in the country, he was so afraid of punishment as to
have absconded, lodging in a hollow tree in the fields, till a hue and
cry restored him to his parents. At the Charter-House was formed
that friendship between him and Sir Richard Steele, which led to
their close alliance in a new kind of literary undertaking. Addison
could not but feel his own superiority; and Spence intimates, that the
one was too fond of displaying, and the other too servile in acknowledging
it. Steele occasionally availed himself not only of his friendâs
pen, but of his purse. Johnson has given currency to the story, that
Addison enforced the repayment of 100<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> by an execution, and the fact
is said to have been related by Steele himself, with tears in his eyes.
Hooke, the Roman historian, professed to have received it from Pope.
The biographer sarcastically remarks, that the borrower probably had
not much purpose of repayment; but the lender, who âseems to have
had other notions of 100<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i>, grew impatient of delay.â Now no date
is assigned to this anecdote; and Addisonâs finances were so low
during the greater part of his life, that he might have suffered greatly
by the disappointment; nor does it detract from the character of a
man in narrow circumstances, that he entertains serious notions
of 100<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i></p>

<p class='c000'>In 1687 Addison was entered at Queenâs College, Oxford, where
he took the degree of M.A., February 14, 1693. One of his early
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>poetical attempts was âAn Account of the greatest English Poets,
inscribed to H. S.;â initials which have been currently assigned to
Dr. Henry Sacheverell, who is indebted, for no enviable place in
history, to his trial and its consequences. But a college friend of Addison
has left it on record, that the initials were the property of a gentleman
bearing the same name, who died young, after having shown some
promise in writing a history of the Isle of Man, and who bequeathed
his papers to Addison, containing, among other things, the plan of a
tragedy 011 the death of Socrates, which the legatee had some thoughts
of working up himself. In this poem the writer tells his friend that
Spenser can no longer charm an understanding age. Now the judgment
of the present age disclaims this confident decision; nor would it
be worth recording, but for Spenceâs assertion, that the critic had
never read the âFaery Queene,â when he drew its character. In after
life he spoke of his own poem as a âpoor thing;â but his general
level as a versifier was not high. The âCampaignâ is his masterpiece
in rhyme.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was indebted to Congreve for his introduction to Montague, then
Chancellor of the Exchequer. Johnson says, that âhe was then
learning the trade of a courtier, and subjoined Montague as a poetical
name to those of Cowley and of Dryden.â In 1695 he wrote a poem
to King William, with an introduction addressed to Lord Somers,
who is said by Tickell to have sent a message to the author to desire
his acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1699, he obtained an annual pension of 300<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">l.</span></i> to enable him to
travel. He passed the first year in preparation at Blois, and then
departed for Italy. That he was duly qualified to appreciate the
attractions of âclassic ground,ââhis own phrase, sneered at for affectation
by contemporary critics, but since sanctioned by general adoption,âappears
by his âTravels,â and by the letter from Italy to Lord Halifax.
His âDialogues on Medalsâ were composed at this time. On
the death of King William, in March, 1702, he became distressed for
money by the stoppage of his pension. This compelled him to become
tutor to a travelling squire. The engagement seems to have been
for one year only, for he was at Rotterdam in June, 1703. In the
âGentlemanâs Magazineâ for November, 1835, may be found three
very curious, because characteristic, letters, from the Duke of Somerset,
surnamed by his contemporaries the Proud, to old Jacob Tonson,
forwarding a proposal to Addison to undertake the office of tutor to
his son, then going abroad. We transcribe a passage from the second
letter, as a sample of the proud Dukeâs liberality. âI desire he may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>be more on the account of a companion in my sonâs travels, than as a
governor, and as such shall account him; my meaning is that neither
lodging, travelling, nor diet, shall cost him sixpence, and over and
above that, my son shall present him at the yearâs end with a hundred
guineas, as long as he is pleased to continue in that service to my son,
by taking great care of him, by his personal attendance and advice,
in what he finds necessary during his time of travelling.â It appears
from the Dukeâs quotation of the answer, in the third letter to Tonson,
that Addison had âother notionsâ of this offer than the proposer
entertained. âI will set down his own words, which are these:ââAs
for the recompense that is proposed to me, I must confess I can by no
means see my account in it,â &amp;c.â A hundred guineas and maintenance
was, even in those days, a mean appointment from a Duke to a
gentleman.</p>

<p class='c000'>Addison returned to England at the latter end of 1703. In 1704,
at the request of Lord Godolphin, to whom he was introduced by the
Earl of Halifax, he undertook to celebrate the victory of Blenheim,
and composed the first portion of his poem called the âCampaign.â
This proved his introduction into office. After filling some inferior
appointments, he became, in 1706, Under-Secretary of State. About
the same time, he wrote the comic opera of âRosamond,â which was
neglected by the public, has been overpraised by Johnson, and is now
deservedly forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thomas Earl of Wharton was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,
December 4, 1708, and proceeded to his destination April 10,
1709, accompanied by Addison as his Secretary. Addison therefore
left London two days before the commencement of the âTatler,â the
first number of which came out April 12; and his own first contribution
appeared May 26. His last was No. 267, and the work ended
with No. 271, January 2, 1710â11. In No. 93 is an article on
a âLetter from Switzerland, with Remarks on Travelling,â and a sly
hint that âFools ought not to be exported,â in Addisonâs happiest style
of playful satire. The praise of original design clearly belongs to the
projector of the âTatler.â Tickell however was justified in saying,
that Addisonâs aid âdid not a little contribute to advance its reputation;â
and Steele candidly allows, that his coadjutor not only assisted
but improved his original scheme. In his dedication of the comedy
of the âDrummer,â he says, âIt was advanced indeed, for it was raised
to a greater thing than I intended it; for the elegance, purity, and
correctness, which appeared in his writings, were not so much to my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>purpose, as in any intelligible manner I could, to rally all those singularities
of human life, through the different professions and characters
in it, which obstruct any thing that was truly good and great.â</p>

<p class='c000'>The first No. of the âSpectatorâ appeared March 1, 1710â11, and
the paper was discontinued December 6, 1712; No. 555 concluded the
seventh volume, as first collected by the publishers. The work was
resumed June 18, 1714, with No. 556, and the eighth volume closed
with No. 635. Of the first forty-five papers of the revived âSpectator,â
Addison wrote twenty-three; more than half: he did not contribute to
the last thirty-five. Notwithstanding the avowed purpose of exclusively
treating general topics, Steeleâs Whiggism once burst its bounds, by reprinting
in the âSpectatorâ a preface of Dr. Fleetwood to some sermons,
for the purpose of attracting the Queenâs notice to it. Had the Number
been published at the usual hour, the household might have devised
means for its suppression, with some plausible excuse for its absence
from the royal breakfast table; but the non-issue until twelve oâclock,
the time fixed for that meal, left no opening for cabal, and her Majestyâs
subjects were, for her sake, deprived of their morningâs speculation till
that hour. In No. 10 Addison states the daily sale at three thousand:
Johnson makes it sixteen hundred and eighty; apparently far below
the real number. The latter number is given on calculation from the
product of the tax; the assertion of the publisher was Addisonâs
authority; and he might, in the commencement of the work, have
indulged in the puff oblique. No. 14, composed of Letters from the
Lionâfrom an Under-Sextonâon the Masqueradeâand Puppet
Show, is selected by the annotators, as âmeriting the attention of
such as pretend to distinguish with wonderful facility between Addisonâs
and Steeleâs papers.â It is wholly Steeleâs. The âGuardianâ
was published in the interval, between the âSpectatorâsâ being laid
down and taken up again. The first Number came out March 12,
1713; the last, October 1, 1713. Inattention to marks has sometimes
subjected Addison to undeserved censure. Dr. Blair vindicates Tassoâs
description of Sylvia against the âGuardian;â but by a double inadvertence,
he quotes No. 38 for a passage contained in 28, and ascribes
to Addison what was written by Steele. The âWhig Examiner,â and
the âFreeholder,â both exclusively Addisonâs, have been enabled by
their wit to survive the usual fate of party-writings. The former is so
much more pungent than usual with the author, and excited so much
alarm and jealousy in Swift, that he triumphantly remarks, âit is now
down among the dead men;â part of the burthen of a popular Tory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>song. The humour of the latter, Steele thought too gentle for such
blustering times; and is reported to have said, that the ministry made
use of a lute, when they should have called for a trumpet.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the demise of the other papers, Hughes formed a project of a
society of learned men of various characters, who were to meet and
carry on a conversation on all subjects, empowering their secretary to
draw up any of their discourses, or publish any of their writings, under
the title of Register. Addison, in answer, applauds the specimen,
and approves the title; but adds, âTo tell you truly, I have been so
taken up with thoughts of that nature, for these two or three years
last past, that I must now take some time <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour me dÃ©lasser</span></i>, and lay
in fuel for a future work. I am in a thousand troubles for poor
Dick, and wish that his zeal for the public may not be ruinous to
himself; but he has sent me word, that he is determined to go on,
and that any advice I can give him, in this particular, will have no
weight with him.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Tickell says respecting Cato, âHe took up a design of writing a
play upon this subject, when he was very young at the university, and
even attempted something in it there, though not a line as it now stands.
The work was performed by him in his travels, and retouched in
England, without any formal design of bringing it on the stage, till
his friends of the first quality and distinction prevailed with him to
put the last finishing to it, at a time when they thought the doctrine
of liberty very seasonable.â Cibber says, that in 1704 he had the
pleasure of reading the first four acts privately with Steele, who told him
they were written in Italy. Oldmixon in his âArt of Criticism,â 1728,
talks about Addisonâs reluctance to resume the work, and his request
to Hughes to write the fifth act. According to Pope, the first packed
audience was made to support the âDistressed Mother;â the scheme
was tried again for Cato with triumphant effect. The love-scenes
are the weakest in the play, and are by some supposed to have been
foisted on the original plan, to humour the false taste of the modern
stage. When the tragedy was shown to Pope, he advised the author
to print it, without committing it to the theatre, as thinking it better
suited to the closet than representation.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Lord Sunderland was sent as lord lieutenant to Ireland in
1714, Addison was appointed his secretary. This, as well as another
step in his promotion, has been omitted by Johnson. In 1715 he was
made a lord of trade. In 1716 he married the Countess Dowager of
Warwick, to whom he had long paid his addresses. Johnson pleasantly
suggests, that his behaviour might be not very unlike that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Sir Roger to his disdainful widow, and supposes that the lady might
amuse herself by playing with his passion. Spence dates his first
acquaintance with her from his appointment as tutor to the young
earl; but as neither the time of that appointment is known, nor the
footing on which he stood with the family, the first steps in this affair
are left in obscurity. The result is better known. Mr. Tyers, in an
unpublished essay on âAddisonâs Life and Writings,â says, âHolland
House is a large mansion, but could not contain Mr. Addison, the
Countess of Warwick, and one guest, peace.â He became possessed
of this house by his marriage, and died in it. His last and great promotion
was to the dignity of Secretary of State in 1717; but he was
unfit for it, and gained no new laurels by it. He carried so much of
the author into the office of the statesman, that he could not issue an
order of mere routine without losing his time in hunting after unnecessary
niceties of language. During his last illness he sent for Gay,
and with a confession of having injured him, promised him a recompense
if he recovered. He did not specify the nature of the injury;
nor could Gay, either then or subsequently, guess at his meaning.
Dr. Young furnished the received account of his interview with
Lord Warwick on his death-bed; but there appears to be no ground
for Johnsonâs imputation on the young manâs morals or principles,
or for supposing that it was a last effort on Addisonâs part to reclaim
him. Young mentions his lordship as a youth finely accomplished,
without a hint of looseness either in opinions or conduct.
Addison died June 17, 1719: his only child, a daughter, died at
Bilton, in Warwickshire, at an advanced age, in 1797. Not many
days before his death he commissioned Mr. Tickell to collect his
writings; a gentleman of whom Swift said that Addison was a whig,
but Tickell, <em>whigissimus</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>To ascertain the claim of short periodical papers to originality of
design, we must look to the state of newspapers at an earlier date.
As vehicles of information they are often mentioned in plays in the
time of James and Charles the First. Carew, in his âSurvey of
Cornwall,â first published in 1602, quotes â<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mercurius Gallo-Belgicus</span>.â
Till the beginning of the eighteenth century, the periodical press had
been exclusively political; no class of writers but divines and theoretical
reasoners had administered to the moral wants of society: certain
gentlemen, therefore, of liberal education, and men of the world,
combined to furnish practical instruction in an amusing form, by fictions
running parallel with the political newspaper. Addison announces
the design âto bring philosophy out of closets and libraries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables
and in coffee-houses.â In the character of his fictitious friend the
clergyman, he speaks of âthe great use this paper might be of to the
public, by reprehending those vices which are too trivial for the chastisement
of the law, and too fantastical for the cognizance of the
pulpit.â Another object was to allay party-violence by promoting
literary taste; in Steeleâs figurative language, to substitute the lute
for the trumpet. On this subject Addison says, âI am amazed that
the press should be only made use of in this way by news-writers, and
the zealots of parties; as if it were not more advantageous to mankind
to be instructed in wisdom and virtue than in politics, and to be made
good fathers, husbands, and sons, than counsellors and statesmen.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Beattie, who published an edition of Addisonâs works in 1790,
with a Life prefixed, says that he was once informed, but had forgotten
on what authority, that Addison had collected three manuscript volumes
of materials. He might have found this in Tickellâs Life. âIt would
have been impossible for Mr. Addison, who made little or no use of
letters sent in by the numerous correspondents of the Spectator, to
have executed his large share of this task in so exquisite a manner,
if he had not ingrafted into it many pieces that had lain by him in
little hints and minutes, which he from time to time collected, and
ranged in order, and moulded into the form in which they now appear.
Such are the essays upon wit, the pleasures of the imagination, the
critique upon Milton, and some others.â</p>

<p class='c000'>The original delineation of Sir Roger de Coverley, for the management
and keeping of which character Addison has been highly extolled,
must unquestionably be ascribed to Steele. He drew the outlines;
Addison principally worked up the portrait. Johnson not only takes
a false view of the character, but in contradiction to every judgment
but his own, represents the author as sinking under the weight of it.
âThe irregularities in Sir Rogerâs conduct seem not so much the
effects of a mind deviating from the beaten track of life, by the pressure
of some overwhelming idea, as of habitual rusticity, and that negligence
which solitary grandeur naturally generates. The variable
weather of the mind, the flying vapours of incipient madness, which
from time to time cloud reason, without eclipsing it, it requires so much
nicety to exhibit, that Addison seems to have been deterred from prosecuting
his own design.â This seems to be a mistake from beginning to
end. Addison had no more design to impute incipient madness to Sir
Roger, than to his contrast, Sir Andrew Freeport. Habitual rusticity
is not the prevailing feature in a man who visited the metropolis every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>season: a main beauty of the picture is, that Sir Roger is always
a gentleman, although an odd one. Hear Lord Orford on the subject.
âNatural humour was the primary talent of Addison. His
character of Sir Roger de Coverley, though inferior, is only inferior
to Shakspeareâs Falstaff.â But however prejudiced or mistaken
Johnson might be in this particular instance, when he deals in generalities,
he traces the peculiar merits of Addisonâs manner with the
touch of a master. âHe copies with so much fidelity, that he can
be hardly said to invent; yet his exhibitions have an air so much
original, that it is difficult to suppose them not merely the product of
imagination.â</p>

<p class='c000'>An attempt has been made to compare the humour of Addison with
that of MoliÃ¨re, of whom Lord Chesterfield said that no man ever had
so much. But a parallel between an essayist and a dramatic writer
will not run straight; the construction of the drama gives so much
greater latitude to the display of humour, and allows of so much
nearer an approach to extravagance, that there can be no drawn game
between them, and the essayist will almost always be the loser.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a critic, Addisonâs merit is impartially and ably set forth in
the notes to his Life in Dr. Kippisâs edition of the âBiographia Britannica.â
On that subject Johnson is just and liberal. âAddison is
now despised by some who perhaps would never have seen his defects,
but by the lights which he afforded them.â By some of these arrogant
despisers he has been blamed for deciding by taste rather than
by principles. To this Dr. Warton, who thought him superior to
Dryden as a critic, briefly answers, taste must decide. Addisonâs
style has been universally admired and thought a model. Lord
Orford says of Addison, Swift, Bolingbroke, and Dr. Middleton,
âSuch authors fix a standard by their writings.â Johnson says he did
not wish to be energetic; Dr. Warton affirms that he is so, and that
often. Steele describes his habits of composition. âThis was particular
in this writer, that, when he had taken his resolution, or made
his plan for what he designed to write, he would walk about a room,
and dictate it into language with as much freedom and ease as any
one could write it down, and attend to the coherence and grammar of
what he dictated.â Pope says that he wrote with fluency; but if he
had time to correct, did it slowly and cautiously; but that many of
the âSpectatorsâ were written rapidly, and sent to the press in the
instant; and he doubts whether much leisure for revisal would have
led to improvement. âHe would alter any thing to please his friends,
before publication, but would not retouch his pieces afterwards; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>I believe not one word in Cato, to which I made an objection, was
suffered to stand.â The last line of Cato was Popeâs; a substitute
for the original.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have neither room nor willingness to enter on the jealousy
between these two eminent persons. Bowles vindicates Addisonâs
conduct, and relates the following fact to the credit of his disposition:ââThough
attacked by Dennis as a critic, he never mentioned his
name with asperity, and refused to give the least countenance to a
pamphlet which Pope had written upon the occasion of Dennisâs
stricture on Cato.â The piece here alluded to is the âNarrative of
the Madness of John Dennis.â Pope strangely imputed Addisonâs
pious compositions to the selfish motive of an intention to take orders
and obtain a bishopric on quitting administration. Johnson cites
this as the only proof that Pope retained some malignity from their
ancient rivalship: with this opinion we cannot quite agree.</p>

<p class='c000'>Addisonâs defect of animal spirits condemned him to silence in
general company; but his conversation, when set afloat by wine and
the presence of confidential friends, was brilliant and delightful. Steele
represents him as âhaving all the wit and nature of Terence and
Catullus, heightened with humour more exquisite than any other man
ever possessed.â This high flight is borne out by Popeâs less suspicious
testimony. âAddisonâs conversation had something in it more charming
than I have found in any other man.â Tonson and Spence represent
him as demanding to be the first name in modern wit; and
with Steele as his echo, depreciating Dryden, whom Pope and Congreve
defended against them. We close our account with the following
summary of his character from Hutchinsonâs âHistory of Cumberlandâ:ââAddison
was modest and mild, a scholar, a gentleman, a poet, and
a Christian.â</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>BRAMANTE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The name of Bramante derives a marked distinction from its
intimate connexion with the history of the famous church of St. Peter
at Rome, and is further interesting in its association with the names
of Michael Angelo, of Raphael, and of the pontiff Julius II.
Bramante is justly noted among the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cinquecento</span></i> architects, as a
powerful co-operator in the great work of restoring, under certain
modifications, the style of ancient Rome. The leader of this reformation
is universally acknowledged to have been Brunelleschi; while
Palladio is honoured as having effected its final and permanent establishment.
Brunelleschi had evinced his daring and his taste in projecting
the vast dome of Florence cathedral, the character of which,
however, exhibited only a slight advance towards the regular architecture
of antiquity; and it remained for a successor to emulate at
once the majestic elevation of the Florentine cupola, and the more
classic beauty of the Roman Pantheon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brunelleschi died in 1444, a circumstance which we mention
as giving additional interest to the fact, that, in 1444, Bramante was
born. The family of the latter, his birth-place, and even his name,
are matters of some obscurity; but there is reason to believe that his
parentage was humble, and that he was born in the territory of Urbino.
Whether at Urbino the capital of the Duchy, or at Castel
Durante, at Fermignano, or at Monte Asdrubale, there are no means
of deciding, unless we admit as evidence in favour of the latter place
an existing medal in the Museo Mazzachelliano, whereon are inscribed
the words âBramantes Asdruvaldinus.â He is variously called Bramante
Lazzari, Lazzaro Bramante, and is spoken of as â<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Donato di
Urbino, cognominato Bramante</span>.â</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He seems to have evinced, at an early age, a general feeling for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>poetry and art; and is said to have first studied painting assisted by
the works of Fra. Bartolomeo Corradini. During a sojourn at Milan
he obtained the friendship of the poet Gaspero Visconti, and in the
capacity of a sonneteer and improvisatore exhibited an unusual
facility of composition. Of his abilities as a painter in distemper and
fresco, examples are to be seen in that city, and at other places in the
Milanese territory. On his subsequent removal to Rome, he was
employed to execute some paintings (which no longer exist) in the
church of S. Giovanni Laterano.</p>

<p class='c000'>Architecture, however, soon claimed Bramante as more particularly
her own, and he manifested a zealous ardour in the study of classic
examples. It does not appear that he published any volumes on the
subject, but we are credibly informed that he industriously measured
the ancient remains of Rome, and of Adrianâs villa at Tivoli.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cardinal Caraffa was among the first to form an estimate of his
merits, and commissioned him to rebuild the cloisters of the Monastery
della Pace at Rome. He also superintended the execution of the
Trastevere Fountain for Pope Alexander VI., and erected great part
of the palace della Cancellaria. The church of S. Lorenzo in
Damaso, and the circular chapel in the cloister of S. Pietro in Montorio
(where St. Peter is said to have been crucified) are also of
Bramanteâs architecture; nor should we omit to mention him as the
designer of the palace in the Piazza di Scossacavalli, which for some
time belonged to the English crown, and was presented by Henry
VIII. to the Campeggi. Bramanteâs designs for other palaces and
churches were numerous. Several buildings in Milan are attributed
to him, as well as an imperial palace for the Duke of Urbino (never
finished), and the church dellâ Incoronata at Lodi.</p>

<p class='c000'>The established fame of Bramante now recommended him to Pope
Julius II., who had formed the idea of uniting the old Vatican palace
with the Belvedere by means of a magnificent court, an engraving of
which, as it was first executed by Bramante, is to be seen in the public
library erected by the Corsini princes. The division of the court by
the Vatican library, subsequently erected by Sixtus V., and other
additions and alterations, have utterly destroyed the effect of Bramanteâs
design, though the principal architectural features still
remain. Among these, in a lofty central pile of building, is a vast
semicircular headed niche, the archivolt of which springs from the
cornices of two lofty wing compartments, appearing, it must be confessed,
more like the section of an interior, than an external elevation.
It is as if the opposite walls in the length of a cathedral choir were taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>away, the grand altar recess being alone suffered to remain; and it may
be regarded as a very curious instance of a passion for the spherical
vault, which thus prompted Bramante to turn it, as it were, inside out;
and to take from the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cellÃ¦</span> of the temples of Peace, and of Venus
and Rome, the idea of the garden alcove.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bramante was now high in favour with Julius II.; and, having
invented an ingenious machine for stamping the leaden seals attached
to the papal bulls, was rewarded with the office â<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">del Piombo</span></i>.â He
attended the Pope to Bologna, when that city was united to the states
pontifical in 1504, and served his Holiness in the capacity of military
engineer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our account of Bramante now resolves itself into the history of St.
Peterâs church, the antecedent progress of which may be thus briefly
stated:â</p>

<p class='c000'>St. Peter being buried within the site of Neroâs Circus, Constantine
erected (<span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A.D.</span></span> 324) a magnificent church over the apostleâs remains.
During the lapse of eleven centuries, it fell into decay, and in
the pontificate of Nicholas V. (1450) a new building was commenced
from designs by Alberti. On the death of Nicholas, the
works were discontinued till Paul II. caused them again to proceed:
but it must be understood that the structure then in course of erection
was in a great measure mixed up with Constantineâs church, many
remaining parts of which were to be incorporated in the new building.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ascent of Julius II. to the papal throne was at that period,
when the revived taste for classical architecture suddenly pervaded
Italy, and left him assured of general support in his boldly formed
resolution of demolishing the old building with all its subsequent
amendments, and of erecting an entirely new structure, that
should stand paramount in the modern world for vastness and splendour.
It has been said, that the idea of the new church originated in
a suggestion by San Gallo, that the gorgeous sepulchral monument
which Julius, in honour of himself, had commissioned Michael Angelo
to execute, should be placed in a church of corresponding grandeur,
purposely built to receive it. Be this as it may, the new St. Peterâs
was resolved on: designs were sent in by various architects, and
several were submitted by Bramante, who proved, as might be expected,
the successful competitor. His ideas were as colossal as the
ambition of his patron:ââI will raise,â said the architect, âthe Pantheon
on the Temple of Peace!â</p>

<p class='c000'>Bramanteâs plan was a Latin cross. The area of intersection was
to be surrounded with massive piers, having columns between as in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>the Pantheon; and the noble dome of the latter edifice, in the august
novelty of its exalted position, was to be freely imitated. A medal
struck in honour of Bramante shows the faÃ§ade of his design, having
two <em>campaniles</em>, or towers, flanking a central compartment. In examining
the practicability of his plans, he failed not to inspect the quarries
of Tivoli, and was confirmed by the discovery that they would
yield him blocks of nine feet in diameter. Into the pecuniary means
of construction he did not however so closely examine. The contributions
of a world would have been necessary to the full realization of
his plans, which were considerably reduced by succeeding architects.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first stone of the new edifice was laid on the 18th of April,
1506; and the works proceeded with a rapidity more pleasing
perhaps to the impatient spirit of Julius, than beneficial to the stability
of so vast an edifice. Either to this haste on the part of the
pontiff, or to a want of constructive care on his own part, must be
attributed the failures which occurred to several of Bramanteâs buildings;
and it is said, that, in the fear of Michael Angeloâs superior
scrutiny, he industriously sought to compass the removal of that great
artist from Rome.</p>

<p class='c000'>His jealousy had been excited by the high admiration with which
Julius regarded Michael Angeloâs talent; and he strove to arrest the
progress of the intended monument, by stimulating in the pope a superstitious
dread of constructing his own tomb. He was, perhaps, not
more envious of Michael Angelo as a rival, than of the art of sculpture as
compared with his own; and it may have been with the view of diverting
the popeâs mind from the engrossing subject of the tomb, that he
suggested that Michael Angelo should be employed in painting the
vault of the Sistine Chapel. Julius, adopting the suggestion, ordered
Bramante to construct a scaffold for the painterâs purpose; but it was
no sooner done than Michael Angelo rejected it as totally unfit, and
invented one himself. If the opposition of these celebrated men had
been hitherto restrained within bounds, it now assumed a more decided
character of hostility. Half the painting of the chapel being
completed, Bramante was desirous that Raphael, then rising into eminence,
should finish the half remaining; expecting, no doubt, that the
latter, being more exclusively a painter, would exhibit a superiority
over one who had chiefly practised as a sculptor. At this, the indignation
of Michael Angelo was naturally fired, and he arraigned at
once, in the presence of the Pope, not only the architectural defects of
Bramanteâs buildings, but likewise the moral faults of his character.
At a former period, however, he had paid full tribute to his rivalâs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>exalted taste, saying, in his letter to a friend, âIt cannot be denied
that Bramante is superior in architecture to all others since the time of
the ancients.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the more pleasing passages of Bramanteâs life, is that which
relates to his friendship for the inimitable Raphael, who was his fellow-countryman,
and, as it is reported, his relation. Certain it is that
Raphael was his pupil in architecture, and that he entertained an
affectionate regard for his master, whose portrait he introduced into
his celebrated picture of the âSchool of Athens,â where Bramante is
represented as describing with his compasses a geometrical figure to
several youths who surround him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bramante died in 1514, one year after his patron Julius II., and
eight years after the commencement of the new St. Peterâs. At this
period the great arches over the central piers were turned, and the
principal chapel opposite the entrance erected. Subsequent additions,
however, to his portion of the building, and material deviations from
his original design, have left us to regard the church in its complete
state as deriving little else than its general idea from the genius of its
first architect. His remains were deposited in it with great pomp,
being attended by the Papal court, and the leading professors of art.
He is described as lively and agreeable in manner, and, notwithstanding
his quarrels with Michael Angelo, of a liberal and generous
disposition. He seems rather to have been distinguished by a bold
and fertile fancy, than by any great attainments in the mechanical
department of his profession; and to form a just estimate of his
designs, they should be considered with reference to the progressive
state of architectural taste, and cautiously adopted as examples for
imitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The best authorities to be consulted on this subject are Vasari,
Tiraboschi, Milizia, and Condivi.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Anne Louise Germaine Necker, the celebrated daughter of a
celebrated father, was born at Paris, April 22, 1766. In her earliest
years she manifested uncommon vivacity of perception and depth of
feeling; and at the age of eleven, her sprightliness, her self-possession,
and the eager and intelligent interest which she took in all the
subjects of conversation, rendered her the pet and the wonder of the
brilliant circle which frequented her fatherâs house. Necker himself,
though he delighted in promoting the developement of his daughterâs
talents, was a watchful critic of her faults: âI owe,â she said, âto my
fatherâs penetration, the frankness of my disposition, and the simplicity
of my mind. He exposed every sort of affectation; and, in his
company, I formed the habit of thinking that my heart lay open
to view.â She repaid his care and tenderness by a passionate and
devoted affection, such as scarcely seems to belong to the relationship
which existed between them. Throughout his life, the desire to
minister to his pleasure was her first object, and his death threw a
permanent shade of melancholy over her spirit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Madlle. Necker paid the usual price of mental precocity, in its debilitating
effects upon her bodily constitution. At the age of fourteen,
serious apprehensions were entertained for her life; and she was sent
to St. Ouen, in the neighbourhood of Paris, for the benefit of country
air, with orders to abstain from every species of severe study. Thither
her father repaired at every interval of leisure; and being withdrawn
from the strict line of behaviour prescribed by her mother, who, having
done much herself by dint of study, thought that no accomplishments
graces could be worth possessing which were not the fruit of study,
she passed her time in the unrestrained enjoyment of M. Neckerâs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>society, in the indulgence of her brilliant imagination, and the spontaneous
cultivation of her powerful mind. This course of life was
more favourable to the developement of that poetical, ardent, and
enthusiastic temper, which was the source of so much enjoyment, and
so much distinction, than to the habits of self-control without which
such a temper is almost too dangerous to be called a blessing. Her
character at this period of life is thus described by her relation and
biographer, Mad. Necker de Saussure: âWe may figure to ourselves
Mad. de Stael, in her early youth, entering with confidence
upon a life, which to her promised nothing but happiness. Too benevolent
to expect hatred from others, too fond of talent in others to
anticipate the envy of her own, she loved to exalt genius, enthusiasm,
and inspiration, and was herself an example of their power. The love
of glory, and of liberty, the inherent beauty of virtue, the pleasures of
affection, each in turn afforded subjects for her eloquence. Not that
she was always in the clouds: she never lost presence of mind, nor
was she run away with by enthusiasm.â In later life her good taste
led her to abstain from this lofty vein of conversation, especially when
it was forced upon her: âI tramp in the mire with wooden shoes,
whenever they would force me to live always in the clouds.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Endowed with such qualities, the <em>effect</em> which Madlle. Necker produced
upon her introduction to society was as brilliant as her friends
could desire, though the effervescence of imagination and youthful
spirits sometimes led her to commit breaches of etiquette, which might
have been fatal to the success of a less accomplished debutant. At
the age of twenty, in 1786, she married the Baron de Stael Holstein,
ambassador of Sweden at the court of France. He was much the
elder, and the matter seems to have been arranged by her parents,
with her acquiescence indeed, but without her heart being at all interested
in the connexion. And we trace the effect of her ruling passion,
love of her father, in the Baron de Staelâs engagement not to
take her to reside in Sweden, without her free consent. During a
large portion of their married life they were separated from each other
by the baronâs absences from France; but when age and sickness
weighed him down, she hastened to comfort him, and his last hours
(in 1802) were soothed by her presence and watchful care. By this
marriage Mad. de Stael had four children, of whom only a son and
a daughter survived her: the latter became the wife of the Duc de
Broglie; the former inherited his fatherâs title, and has won for himself
a creditable place in the literature of the age.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>At the beginning of the revolution, Mad. de Stael watched the new
prospects opening 011 her country with joyful anticipation: but she
was shocked and disgusted by the ferocious excesses which ensued.
Her love of liberty was too sincere to let her justify the policy, or join
the party of the court, but, with an admirable courage, she used the
powerful influence of her talents and her connexions to save as many
as possible of the victims of that frenzied time. She arranged a plan
for the escape of the royal family from the Tuileries; and after the
death of Louis XVI., she had the boldness (for so it must be called)
to publish her â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">DÃ©fense de la Reine</span>.â It needed all the authorâs tact
and ingenuity, as well as eloquence, so to plead the queenâs cause,
as, on the one hand, not to compromise the dignity of her innocence,
and, on the other, not to aggravate the rage of those who clamoured
for her destruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having passed safely through the Reign of Terror, Mad. de Stael
hailed the establishment of the Directory in 1795, as the commencement
of a settled government. Through life she devoted a large portion
of her attention to politics, which she designated as comprehending
within their sphere, morality, religion, and literature; and at this
period especially, while her fame in literature was not yet established,
and the ardent enthusiasm of her temper was unchecked by misfortune,
she not only took an eager interest in the course of affairs, but
exerted her powers to gain some influence in the direction of them.
Her brilliant conversation drew around her the ablest and most accomplished
men of the French capital; and in Paris, where the public
opinion of France is compressed into a narrow space, wit or beauty
have always had an influence unknown to the more sedate nations of
the north. To this period of her life belong the treatises,âmore interesting
as specimens of her genius, than important for the truth of her
theoriesââ<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De lâInfluence des Passions sur le Bonheur des Individus
et des Nations</span>,â published in 1796, of which only the first part, relating
to individuals, was completed; and â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De la LittÃ©rature considerÃ©e
dans ses Rapports avec les Institutions Sociales</span>,â published in 1800:
subjects, it has been truly said, which demand the observation and
study of a whole life. It is not on these, therefore, that her fame is
based. But the latter has the great merit, according to the testimony
of Sir James Mackintosh, of being the first attempt to treat the philosophy
of literary history upon a bold and comprehensive scale.</p>

<p class='c000'>But she could not aspire to âdirect the storm,â without running
some danger of being caught in it; and it is probable, as indeed she
herself admits, that if she had foreseen the troubles which political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>influence was to bring upon her, she would have been well pleased
to resign all pretension to it. At the end of 1799, Bonaparte rose to
power on the ruin of the Directory. That remarkable man inspired
Mad. de Stael from the first with an indescribable fear and dislike,
which she has expressed throughout her very interesting work, entitled
â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dix AnnÃ©es dâExil</span>;â and as she saw at once the danger to
which the cause of rational liberty was exposed by his ambition, and
feared not to express her sentiments, her house became the focus of
discontent. Benjamin Constant, then one of her intimate associates,
having prepared and communicated to her a speech to expose the
dawning tyranny of the First Consul, warned her that, if spoken, it
would necessarily be followed by the desertion of the brilliant society
which she loved, and by which she was surrounded. She replied,
âWe must do as we think right.â It was accordingly pronounced
on the following day, on the evening of which her favourite circle was
to assemble at her own house. Before six oâclock she received ten
notes of excuse. âThe first and second I bore well enough, but as
one note came after another, they began to disturb me. I appealed
in vain to my conscience, which had bidden me resign the pleasures
which depended on Bonaparteâs favour: so many good sort of persons
blamed me, that I could not hold fast enough by my own view of the
question.â And she says just before, with her usual candour, âIf I
had foreseen what I have suffered, dating from that day, I should not
have been resolute enough to decline M. Constantâs offer to abstain
from coming forward, for the sake of not compromising me.â The
speech was followed by an intimation from FouchÃ©, that Mad. de
Staelâs retirement from Paris for a short time would be expedient.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the spring of 1800, Bonaparteâs absence upon the campaign of
Marengo, and the publication of her work on literature, brought
Mad. de Stael again into fashion. From that time until 1802, she
remained undisturbed, and divided her time chiefly between Paris,
and her fatherâs residence at Coppet, on the Lake of Geneva. In the
latter year (in which she published âDelphineâ) her intimacy with Bernadotte
caused the First Consul to regard her with suspicion, though
the dread of being banished from the delights of Parisian society had
taught her prudence. âThey pretend,â he said, âthat she neither talks
politics, nor mentions me; but I know not how it happens, that people
seem to like me less after visiting her.â Prudence, or the warning of her
friends, detained Mad. de Stael at Coppet during the winter of 1802â3:
but when war broke out, and she thought that Bonaparteâs attention was
fully occupied by the proposed descent upon England, she could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>resist the thirst of conversation which always drew her to Paris. She
did not venture to enter the city; but she had not been long in its
neighbourhood, when she was terribly disconcerted by a peremptory
order not to appear within forty leagues of the metropolis. She candidly
avows that â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la conversation FranÃ§aise nâexiste quâÃ  Paris, et
la conversation a Ã©tÃ©, depuis mon enfance mon plus grand plaisir</span>.â
The rest of France, therefore, had no attraction for her, and she determined
to visit Germany. Weimar was her first place of abode,
where she became acquainted with Goethe, Wieland, and Schiller,
and, under their auspices, commenced her study of the German language
and literature. In 1804, she proceeded to Berlin; but she
was suddenly recalled to Switzerland by the illness and death of
M. Necker.</p>

<p class='c000'>To this most painful loss Mad. Necker de Saussure attributes a
deep and beneficial influence on her friendâs character. It inspired a
melancholy which perhaps never was entirely dissipated, it raised her
thoughts to a more exalted strain of meditation, and gave vigour and
consistency to those reverential feelings, which before were perhaps
hardly definite enough to be termed religion. At this time she composed
her account of the private life of M. Necker, of which B. Constant
has said, that no other of her works conveys so good a notion
of the author. Shortly after she visited Italy for the first time. The
grand and solemn remains of antiquity harmonized with the melancholy
of her mind; and in this journey was developed a love of art,
and, in a less degree, a taste for scenery, of which up to this time she
seems to have been strangely deficient. The fruit of her travels
appeared in âCorinne,â written after her return to Coppet in 1805,
and published at Paris early in 1807, which raised her to the first
class of living writers. Mad. Necker de Saussure says, in the strain
of high panegyric, â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il nâeut quâune voix, quâun cri dâadmiration dans
lâEurope lettrÃ©e; et ce phÃ©nomÃ¨ne fut partout un Ã©vÃ©nement</span>;â and
Sir James Mackintosh, who read it in India, in a translation, says,
âI swallow Corinne slowly, that I may taste every drop. I prolong
my enjoyment, and really dread the termination.â Dictated by the
same leading idea as âDelphine,â but far superior in depth and truth
of sentiment, as well as eloquence, and genuine poetic ardour, it was
also free from the moral objections to the former novel. Each heroine,
according to the lively author first quoted, is a transcript from the
author herself. ââCorinneâ is the ideal of Mad. de Stael; âDelphineâ
is her very self in youth.â A similar idea occurred to Mackintosh,ââIn
the character of âCorinne,â Mad. de Stael draws an imaginary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>selfâwhat she is, what she had the power of being, and what she
can easily imagine that she might have become. Purity, which her
sentiments and principles teach her to love; talents and accomplishments,
which her energetic genius might easily have acquired; uncommon
scenes, and incidents fitted for her extraordinary mind; and
even beauty, which her fancy contemplates so constantly, that she can
scarcely suppose it to be foreign to herself, and which, in the enthusiasm
of invention, she bestows on this adorned as well as improved
self,âthese seem to be the materials out of which she has formed
âCorinne,â and the mode in which she reconciled it to her knowledge
of her own character.... The grand defect is the want of reposeâtoo
much, and too ingenious reflectionâtoo uniform an ardour
of feeling. The understanding is fatigued, the heart ceases to feel.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the publication of âCorinne.â Mad. de Stael had ventured
into the neighbourhood of Paris. The book contained nothing hostile
to Napoleon; but the new wreath of fame which the author had woven
for herself revived his spleen, and she soon received a peremptory order
to quit France. This was a bitter mortification. We have mentioned
her ruling love of conversation: and to her Paris was the world;
beyond its limits life was vegetation. âGive me the Rue du Bac,â she
said to those who extolled the Lake of Geneva; âI would prefer living
in Paris on a fourth story, with a hundred louis a year.â The chief
studies of her exile were German literature and metaphysics. In the
autumn of 1807 she visited Vienna, where she spent a year in tranquil
enjoyment, soothed by the respect and admiration, and gratified by
the polished manners and conversation of the exalted circles in which
she moved, and undisturbed by the petty tyranny which, in her stolen
visits to France, always hung over her head. In 1808 she returned
to Coppet, to arrange the materials for her great work on Germany.
Having devoted nearly two years to this task, she went to France in
the summer of 1810, the decree of exile being so far relaxed, that she
was permitted, as before, to reside forty leagues from the capital.
Her principal object was to superintend the printing of her work,
which was to be published at Paris. After passing safely, though
with many alterations, through the censorship, the last proof was
corrected, September 23. Scarcely was this done, and 10,000
copies struck off, when the whole impression was seized and
destroyed. Mad. de Stael fortunately was enabled, by timely warning,
to secrete the manuscript. This blow was accompanied by an order
to quit France without delay. America, which she had expressed a
desire to visit, and Coppet, were the only places offered to her choice:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>an attempt to reach England, which was her secret wish, would
have been followed by immediate arrest. She chose to return to her
paternal home. There the Emperorâs persecution, and her hatred of
him, reached their height; and though not to be ranked with the
graver offences of tyranny, his treatment of her was of a most irritating
character, and unbecoming any but a low-minded despot. It
was intimated that she had better confine her excursions to a circle
of two leagues; her motions were watched, even within her own
house; to be regarded as her friend was equivalent to a sentence of
disgrace or dismissal, to any person dependent on the government;
her sons were forbidden to enter their native country; M. Schlegel,
their domestic tutor, was ordered to quit Coppet; and worst of all,
her two dearest friends, M. de Montmorency and Mad. Recamier, were
banished France for having presumed to visit her. These, and more
trifling delinquencies are set forth with most stinging sarcasm, in her
âTen Years of Exile.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Harassed beyond endurance, she resolved to make an attempt to escape
from these never-ending vexations. But whither to go? She could
not obtain permission to reside elsewhere; and if Napoleon demanded
her, no continental power, except Russia, could give her an asylum.
To obtain a conveyance to England was impossible, except from some
port to the north of Hamburg; and to reach that distant region, it
was necessary to traverse the whole of Europe, in constant danger of
being intercepted and detained. After eight months of irresolution,
she found courage and opportunity to make the attempt; and quitting
Coppet secretly, she reached Berne in safety, obtained a passport for
Vienna, and hastily traversing Switzerland and the Tyrol, arrived at
the Austrian capital, June 6, 1812. But this was neither a safe nor
pleasant resting-place. The Emperor was in attendance on his son-in-law
at Dresden; and the Austrian police thought fit to pay their
court to Napoleon, by following up the example of annoyance which
he had set. Mad. de Stael, therefore, hastened on her route to Russia,
through Moravia and Gallicia, honoured all the way by the especial
attention of the police, on whose happy combination of âFrench
machiavelism and German clumsiness,â she has taken ample revenge
in her âTen Years of Exile.â She crossed the Russian frontier, July
14, and in the joy of having escaped at last from the wide-spread
power of Napoleon, she sees and describes every thing in Russia
with an exuberance of admiration, which the position of the country
at that moment, and the kindness which the writer experienced,
may well excuse. The French armies had already crossed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Vistula, and the direct route to St. Petersburg being interrupted,
she was obliged to make a circuit by Moscow. After a hasty
survey of the wonders of that city, she continued her route to St.
Petersburg, where she was received with distinction by the Emperor
and his consort. But England was still the object of her
desires, and towards the end of September, she quitted the metropolis
of Russia for Stockholm. There, during a winter-residence of
eight months, she composed the journal of her travels, to which we
have so often referred; and in the following summer she arrived in
London.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was received in the highest circles of our metropolis with an
enthusiastic admiration, which no doubt was rendered in part to the
avowed enemy of Napoleon, as well as to the woman of genius. Sir
James Mackintosh, in his journal, gives a lively description of the
manner in which she was <em>fÃªted</em>. âOn my return I found the whole
fashionable and literary world occupied with Mad. de Staelâthe most
celebrated woman of this, or perhaps of any age.... She treats
me as the person whom she most delights to honour. I am generally
ordered with her to dinner, as one orders beans and bacon: I have in
consequence dined with her at the houses of almost all the cabinet
ministers. She is one of the few persons who surpass expectation;
she has every sort of talent, and would be universally popular, if in
society she were to confine herself to her inferior talentsâpleasantry,
anecdote, and literature, which are so much more suited to conversation
than her eloquence and genius.â A very characteristic observation
was made by the late Lord DudleyââMad. de Stael was not a
good neighbour; there could be no slumbering near her, she would
instantly detect you.â</p>

<p class='c000'>The publication of her long-expected work on Germany maintained
the interest which Mad. de Stael had excited, during the period of her
residence in England. It is comprised in four parts,âon the aspect and
manners of Germany,âon literature and the arts, as there existing,âon
philosophy and morals,âand on religion and enthusiasm. For
an analysis of it we may best refer to the elaborate criticism of Mackintosh,
in the Edinburgh Review, No. XLIII, who gives it the high
praise of âexplaining the most abstruse metaphysical theories of Germany
precisely, yet perspicuously and agreeably; and combining the
eloquence which inspires exalted sentiments of virtue, with the
enviable talent of gently indicating the defects of men and manners by
the skilfully softened touches of a polite and merciful pleasantry:â and
of being âunequalled for variety of knowledge, flexibility of power,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>elevation of view, and comprehension of mind, among the works of
women, and in the union of the graces of society and literature with
the genius of philosophy, not surpassed by many among men.â</p>

<p class='c000'>After the restoration of the Bourbons, Mad. de Stael returned to
France. She stood high in Louis XVIII.âs favour, who was well
qualified to enjoy and appreciate her powers of conversation; and he
gave a substantial token of his regard by the repayment of two millions
of francs, which the treasury was indebted to her fatherâs estate. At
the return of Napoleon, she fled precipitately to Coppet. She
was too generous to countenance the gross abuse lavished on the
fallen idol; and some sharp repartees, at the expense of the time-servers
of the day, seem to have inspired Napoleon with a hope
that he might work on her vanity to enlist her in his service. He sent
a message, that he had need of her to inspire the French with constitutional
notions: she replied, âHe has done for twelve years without
either me or a constitution, and now he loves one about as little as the
other.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Concerning the last three years of her life, our information is very
scanty. She had contracted a second marriage, with M. Rocca, a
young officer, who, after serving with distinction in the French army
in Spain, had retired, grievously wounded, to Geneva, his native place.
For an account and apology for this much-censured and injudicious
connexion, the date of which we have not found specified, but which
should seem to have been previous to her flight to Coppet, since Rocca
accompanied her on the occasion, we must refer to Mad. Necker
de Saussure. It appears by her statement (and this is a material
consideration in estimating the extent of the ladyâs weakness), that
though she must have been more than forty, and the gentleman was
twenty years younger, she had inspired Rocca with a devoted and romantic
passion. â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je lâaimerai tellement</span>,â he said to one of his friends,
â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quâelle finira par mâÃ©pouser</span>,â and he kept his word. A less distinguished
woman might have contracted a marriage in which the
disparity of years was greater, at a slight expense of wondering and
ridicule; but probably Mad. de Stael felt that the eyes of the world
were upon her, and that any weakness would be eagerly seized by her
enemies; and, perhaps, had a natural dislike to resign a name which
she had rendered illustrious. She judged ill: the secrecy was the
worst part of the affair. The union, though generally believed to exist,
was not avowed until the opening of her will, which authorised her
children to make her marriage known, and acknowledged one son,
who was the fruit of it. The decline of M. Roccaâs health, which never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>recovered the effect of his wounds, induced her to take a second
journey to Italy in 1816. At that time, her own constitution was
visibly giving way. She became seriously ill after her return to
France, and died, July 14, 1817, the anniversary of two remarkable
days of her life. These were, the commencement of the French revolution,
and the day on which, by entering Russia, she finally escaped
from Napoleon. M. Rocca survived her only half a year. He died in
Provence, January 29, 1818.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mad. de Staelâs last great work, which was published after her
death, is entitled â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ConsidÃ©rations sur les principaux ÃvÃ©nements<a id='t170'></a> de la
RÃ©volution FranÃ§aise</span>,â a book, says Mackintosh, âpossessing the
highest interest as the last dying bequest of the most brilliant
writer that has appeared in our days, the greatest writer, of a
woman, that any age or country has produced.â That it was left
unfinished is the less to be regretted, because it is not a regular
history of the revolution, but rather a collection of penetrating observations
and curious details, recorded in the true spirit of historic
impartiality, and therefore a most valuable treasure to the future historian.
The scope of the book, in accordance with her warm admiration
through life of the English constitution, is to show that France
requires a free government and a limited monarchy. The catalogue of
her works is closed by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Åuvres InÃ©dites</span> published in 1820, of
which the principal is âTen Years of Exile.â They are collected in
an edition of eighteen volumes 8vo., published at Paris, in 1819â20,
to which the â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Notice sur le CaractÃ¨re et les Ecrits de Mad. de Stael</span>,â
by Mad. Necker de Saussure, is prefixed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The leading feature of Mad. de Staelâs private character was
her inexhaustible kindness of temper; it cost her no trouble to
forgive injuries. There seems not to have been a creature on
earth whom she hated, except Napoleon. âHer friendships were
ardent and remarkably constant; and yet she had a habit of analysing
the characters, even of those to whom she was most attached,
with the most unsparing sagacity, and of drawing out the detail and
theory of their faults and peculiarities, with the most searching and
unrelenting rigour; and this she did to their faces, and in spite of
their most earnest remonstrances. âIt is impossible for me to do
otherwise,â she would say; âif I were on my way to the scaffold, I
should be dissecting the characters of the friends who were to suffer
with me upon it.ââ Though the excitement of mixed society was
necessary to her happiness, her conversation in a tÃªte Ã  tÃªte with her
intimate friends is said to have been more delightful than her most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>brilliant efforts in public. She was proud of her powers, and loved
to display and talk of them: but her vanity was divested of offensiveness
by her candour and ever-present consideration of others. Of her
errors we would speak with forbearance; but it is due to truth to say
that there were passages in her life which exposed her to serious and
well-founded censure. As a daughter and mother she displayed sedulous
devotion, and the warmest affection. Though never destitute of
devotional feeling, her notions of religion in youth seem to have been
very vague and inefficient. But misfortune drove her sensitive and
affectionate temper to seek some stay, which she found nothing on earth
could furnish; and in later years, her religion, if not deeply learned,
was deeply felt. Of this, the latter portion of Mad. Necker de Saussureâs
work will satisfy the candid reader. And though her testimony
to the truth and value of religion was for the most part indirect,
we may reasonably believe that it was not ineffective. âPlaced in
many respects in the highest situation to which humanity could aspire,
possessed unquestionably of the highest powers of reasoning, emancipated
in a singular degree from prejudices, and entering with the
keenest relish into all the feelings that seemed to suffice for the happiness
and occupation of philosophers, patriots, and lovers, she has still
testified that without religion there is nothing stable, sublime or satisfying;
and that it alone completes and consummates all to which
reason and affection can aspire. A genius like hers, and so directed,
is, as her biographer has well remarked, the only missionary that can
work any permanent effect upon the upper classes of society in modern
timesâupon the vain, the learned, the scornful and argumentative,

  <h2 class='c005'>PALLADIO.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Palladio is distinguished among the renowned professors of his age
as the chief modifier of the revived style of Roman architecture. The
celebrity however which attaches to his name, though just in regard
to its extent, is not always correctly appreciated: inasmuch as a
bigoted admiration for his precepts and designs, on the ground of their
intrinsic excellence, has too frequently supplanted that more sober
estimate, which results from a consideration of the circumstances
under which those precepts and examples were given to the world.
Neither have succeeding ages been sufficiently discriminating in
respect to the predecessors and contemporaries of Palladio, several of
whom either effected or assisted in effecting much, of which the credit
has been given by the world at large too exclusively to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our less informed readers should therefore be apprised that, for
more than a century before the time of Palladio, the ancient Roman
style of architecture had been in progress of revival. Brunelleschi,
who died in 1444, was the first to exhibit, in the upper part of Florence
cathedral, some departure from the Italian Gothic, and an
approach towards the more classic models of old Rome. Alberti,
his pupil, published a system of the Five Orders, and Bramante,
Raphael, and San Gallo, successively advanced the restored style
in the famous Basilica of St. Peter, then erecting. Sansovino, in
several costly edifices at Venice, and San Micheli, in many at
Verona, anticipated the best efforts of Palladio, and Vignola also distinguished
himself as a practical architect and author. Serlio was the
first to measure and describe the ancient examples of Rome; and in
1537, published the first part of his âComplete Treatise on Architecture.â</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Much therefore had been already done to facilitate the operations
of a succeeding candidate for architectural distinction. Materials had
been amassed, and it only remained for a comprehensive genius to
analyse them more closely, to modify them in detail, and to enlarge, by
the exercise of a chastened fancy, the range of their combinations.
At this juncture the subject of our memoir commenced his professional
career.</p>

<p class='c000'>Andrea Palladio was born at Vicenza, November 30, 1518. His
parents are said to have been âin the middle rank of life;â in belief
of which, Temanza discredits the traditionary account that he
worked as a common mason at the Villa di Cricoli, and that the name
âPalladioâ was bestowed upon him, as a kind of ennoblement, by his
patron Trissino, who is said to have been his first architectural instructor.
It is at least certain that, if Trissino taught him not, he
assisted in stimulating his professional ardour. Vitruvius and Alberti
appear to have been his early studies, and allusions are made to his
proficiency in geometry and polite literature at the age of twenty-three.
The knowledge which he derived from books, far from satisfying,
prompted him to seek a deeper insight into the details and the
principles of his art; and, during several visits to Rome, he employed
himself in delineating from admeasurement the ancient remains of that
city.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the earliest testimonies to his growing fame, was the commission
he received to make certain costly additions to the Basilica,
or Hall of Justice, in his native town. The building, before alteration,
seems to have been a dilapidated example of the Italian Gothic style.
It was the opinion of Giulio Romano, who was also consulted on the
subject, that whatever new work might be necessary to afford strength
or supply convenience, the character of the old building should be
strictly preserved; and the appropriate and unprejudiced idea of that
architect merits quite as much praise as the realized design of his
more fortunate competitor. But the romantic rage for the restored
architecture of Pagan antiquity was too prevalent for the common
sense of Giulio to find support; and the GrÃ¦co-Roman arcades of
Palladio were carried round the Gothic basilica, just as, under the
same infatuation, the Corinthian portico of Inigo Jones was subsequently
attached to the old Cathedral of St. Paulâs in London.</p>

<p class='c000'>Considering the particular arrangements and present mixed style of
this noted Basilica to have been peremptorily insisted on by the public,
we can then concede to Palladio the merit of an honourable conquest
over difficulties. The adjoined wood-cut represents in simple outline
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>one of the seven bays or compartments, which form the longitudinal
elevation of the main building. The relative situations of the perpendiculars
<em>a</em> to <em>b</em>, as well as their height, were unalterable. The heights
<em>a</em> to <em>c</em>, and <em>c</em> to <em>d</em>, were also fixed. If, therefore, simple arches had
been adopted, affording the required superficies of aperture, their
limited height must have borne a very disproportioned ratio to their
extended breadth. If columns had been employed alone, the great
width of the interspaces would have been offensively opposed to the
laws which govern that department of architectural design. The
application, therefore, of the smaller columns is here most admirable.
By this measure, a central arch of good proportions is obtained, and a
sufficient supply of light is secured to the interior by the lateral openings
under the imposts, and by the circular apertures above them.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i_174.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>In 1546 the building of St. Peterâs church was in active progress,
when its third architect, San Gallo, died. Trissino, who was in
Rome at the time, exerted himself to establish Palladio as San Galloâs
successor. It is well known however that Michael Angelo was appointed
to that important post, and that he remains recorded on the
scroll of fame as the most celebrated of the architects of St. Peterâs.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1547 Palladio appears to have finally established himself as the
leading architect of Northern Italy; nor was he less fortunate in opportunities
for professional display, than competent to avail himself of
them. Vicenza is literally a museum of Palladian design. Besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>the Basilica, already noticed, and the Olympic Theatre, which was
designed after ancient models, he constructed the great majority of
the private palaces, the proprietors of which were content to impoverish
their fortunes, that they might vie with each other in giving
scope to the talents of their architect. The churches del Redentore
and S. Giorgio, with other edifices public and private, evince the
estimation in which Palladio was held at Venice; and most of the
other cities in the north of Italy also contain examples of his genius.
The country around exhibits a variety of his designs, among which
is the Villa di Capri, called the Rotunda, which has been imitated
by the Earl of Burlington, at Chiswick, and by other architects in
several parts of England. It stands upon a hill, and commands a
beautiful view on every side. This was the architectâs reason for
adopting the four fronts and four porticoes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Oppressed (says Scamozzi) by the multiplicity and fatigue of his
studies, and distressed by the loss of his sons (Leonida and Orazio),
he sank under the influence of an epidemic, which terminated his life
August 19, 1580, at the age of sixty-two. The Olympic Theatre had
only been commenced on the 23rd of May preceding his death, and its
completion was intrusted to his surviving son Silla, who, with Leonida,
had studied architecture. The Olympic Academicians attended
their deceased brother to the grave, and gave public testimony of their
feelings by the recital of funeral odes, and by the observance of all
the âpomp and circumstanceâ consistent with the sepulture of so
eminent a man. He was interred in the church of the Dominicans at
Vicenza.</p>

<p class='c000'>Palladio was no less remarkable for modesty than for professional
eminence. The affability of his conduct won for him the perfect love
of all workmen engaged in his buildings. He was small in stature,
but of admirable presence; and united, to the most respectful bearing,
a jocose and lively manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Palladioâs Treatise on Architecture, in four books, published at
Venice in 1570, has been several times reprinted. A magnificent
edition in three volumes, folio, appeared in London in 1715; and
another has been since issued from the Venetian press. He also composed
a work on the Roman Antiquities generally, and left many manuscripts
on the subject of military as well as civil architecture. He
illustrated the Commentaries of CÃ¦sar, by annexing to Badelliâs translation
of that work, a preface on the military system of the Romans,
and by supplying numerous copper plates, designed for the most part
by his sons Leonida and Orazio. He also studied Polybius, and dedicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>a (yet imprinted) work on the subject to the Grand Duke of
Tuscany. His manuscripts, having been left to the senator Contarini,
were subsequently dispersed, and the Earl of Burlington became
possessed of many of them. The latter nobleman in 1732 published the
fruits of Palladioâs researches concerning the Roman baths; and, some
time after, appeared a truly beautiful work, intitled â<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Fabbriche ei<a id='t176'></a>
Disegni di Andrea Palladio, raccolti ed illustrati da Ottavio Bertotti
Scamozzi</span>.â The latter is by far the most interesting book connected
with the name of Palladio. It enables us, at once, critically to examine
his numerous designs, and to estimate them by a standard far
superior to that which is merely founded on Vitruvian precept and
Roman example. Our present acquaintance with all that Palladio
had the means of knowing, and with very much more of which he was
entirely ignorant, gives us a power and a right of censorship which
the bigot alone will oppose and deny. Since the day of this celebrated
architect, the Roman remains have been measured with more
minute accuracy, and examined with a more philosophical regard to the
principles which regulated the arrangement of their component parts.
The volume of Greek art, compared with which that of Rome was
but a debasing translation, has since that time been opened to the
world; and, however we may continue to admire the industry by
which Palladio obtained his then extended knowledge, the fancy and
pictorial beauty which pervade many of his designs, and the worth
of the architect himself as a man of genius, taste, and letters, it is
yet our duty to direct the architectural student to look much farther
than Vicenza for examples of pure design, and for principles of
essential value.</p>

<p class='c000'>The authorities for the life of Palladio, in addition to those already
referred to, are the works of Vasari, Tiraboschi, and Milizia.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>ELIZABETH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Elizabeth, queen of England, daughter of Henry VIII. by his
second wife, Anne Boleyn, was born September 7, 1533. Her
religious principles were early fixed on the side of the Reformation by
Dr. Parker, her motherâs chaplain, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury,
to whose care Anne Boleyn, not long before her violent death,
recommended this her only child, with the charge that she should not
want his wise and pious counsel. She passed her early days happily,
in the seclusion of private life, uninitiated in the dissipation of the court,
and unmolested by its intrigues; but a few months after the accession
of her sister Mary, she was arrested on suspicion of being concerned
in Wyatâs insurrection, of which it was the object to oppose the
marriage of Mary with the Archduke Philip, and to raise the princess
Elizabeth to the throne. Her life was placed in imminent danger,
by her removal from her abode at Ashridge in Buckinghamshire to
London during a severe illness, in compliance with an order to bring
her, âquick or dead.â She was committed to the Tower, and exposed
to a capital charge of high treason. Two councils were held,
before which she defended herself with entire presence of mind, and
great boldness. Several councillors voted for her death, but it was
ultimately decided that she could be convicted only of misprision of
treason, which was no longer a capital offence. She owed her life,
therefore, to the saving power of the law; not, as has often been
stated, to the intercession of Philip: who did, however, stand forward
afterwards in her behalf so as to obtain a mitigation of the severity
of her imprisonment, which was continued after her acquittal on the
capital charge. It may seem inconsistent in a bigot to the Catholic
religion to interfere in behalf of a person on whom the hopes of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Protestants were known to depend: but Philipâs hatred against France
was greater than his or even his wifeâs zeal in the cause of popery; and
the political motives of his conduct are obvious. In the event of Mary
dying without issue, the Queen of Scotland, who was actually betrothed,
and soon after married to the Dauphin, stood next in succession
to Elizabeth. Supposing the intermediate link in the chain
to be broken, the crown of England, united to that of France, would
give a fatal preponderance to the already formidable rival of the Spanish
monarchy. Philip, therefore, had a direct interest both in preserving
the life and conciliating the good will of the princess: he foresaw
that the demise of his queen must take place before long, and he had
formed the scheme of espousing her sister and successor, for which a
dispensation would readily have been obtained from the pope.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reign of Elizabeth began November 17, 1558, when she was
twenty-five years of age. Her person was graceful, her stature majestic,
and her mien noble. Her features were not regular; but her
eyes were lively and sparkling, and her complexion fair. Her spirit
was high; and her strong natural capacity had been improved by the
most enlarged education attainable in those days. She wrote letters
in Italian before she was fourteen; and at the age of seventeen
she had acquired the Latin, Greek, and French languages. In addition
to these studies she had ventured on the high and various departments
of philosophy, rhetoric, history, divinity, poetry, and music. As soon as
she was fixed on the throne, her interest and her principles engaged her
in plans for the restoration of the Protestant religion. For although
Pope Pius IV. promised, on her submission to the papal supremacy, âto
establish and confirm her royal dignity by his authority,â yet she
must have felt, that with the avowal of popery would be coupled the
virtual admission that her fatherâs divorce from Catherine of Arragon
was null and void; and, consequently, that Anne Boleyn was not a
wife but a concubine, and her own pretensions to the crown downright
usurpation. It was only by rejecting the Pope as her judge
that she could maintain her motherâs fair fame and her own legitimate
descent. Many writers, Bayle among others, have attempted
to prove that she was at heart little more of a Protestant than her
father; and her determination to retain episcopacy was sufficient to
raise that suspicion in the minds of the adherents to the presbyterian
system of church government.</p>

<p class='c000'>While she was princess she received a private proposal of marriage
from Sweden; but she declared, âshe could not change her condition.â
On her becoming queen, her brother-in-law, Philip II. of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Spain, addressed her; but this match also she declined. In the
first parliament of her reign, the house of commons represented it as
necessary to the welfare of the nation âto move her grace to marriage.â
She answered, that by the ceremony of her inauguration she
was married to her people, and her subjects were to her instead of
children; that they would not want a successor when she died;
adding, âAnd in the end, this shall be for me sufficient, that a
marble stone shall declare, that a queen having reigned such a time,
lived and died a virgin.â Several great personages proposed a
matrimonial union with this illustrious princess; but she maintained
her celibacy to the last. The Duke of Anjou seems to have been the
most acceptable of her suitors. On his visit to England in 1581,
not only was he received with much public parade, but she vouchsafed
him strong tokens of personal attachment, and even suffered the marriage
articles to be drawn up. But the strong remonstrances of her
ministers and favourites finally prevailed, and the intended marriage
was broken off.</p>

<p class='c000'>The compilers of memoirs have racked their brains for some plausible
explanation of Elizabethâs repugnance to matrimony. When
overtures were first made to her she was young, and had a good
person, which she spared no art in setting off to advantage: she
was notoriously fond of admiration, and was no less jealous of the
personal beauty of Mary, Queen of Scots, than of her competition as a
rival sovereign, or as a claimant of the crown of England. Neither
prudery nor coldness could be imputed to her. Her gaiety extorted
a sarcastic exclamation from an ambassador: âI have seen the
head of the English church dancing!â She chose her favourites,
Leicester, Essex, Raleigh, and others, from among the most comely,
as well as the most valiant and accomplished of her subjects. Melvil,
who had been sent by Mary of Scotland to the court of Elizabeth,
relates in his Memoirs, that on creating Lord Robert Dudley Earl
of Leicester and Baron of Denbigh, at Westminster, with much
solemnity, the queen assisted at the ceremonial, and he knelt before
her with great gravity: âbut,â he says, âshe could not refrain from
putting her hand to his neck, smilingly tickling him, the French
ambassador and I standing by.â In relating his diplomatic transactions,
he furnishes other proofs of the queenâs partiality for the Earl of
Leicester. He had occasion to name before her âmy Lord of Bedford
and my Lord Robert Dudley. She answered, it appeared I
made but small account of my Lord Robert, seeing I named the
Earl of Bedford before him; but that ere long she would make him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>a far greater Earl; and that I should see it done before my return
home. For she esteemed him as her brother and best friend, whom
she would have herself married, had she ever intended to have taken
a husband. But being determined to end her life in virginity, she
wished the queen her sister might marry him.â It is no wonder that
her propensity to gallantry should have been stigmatized by popish
writers, or that they should even have ventured to assail her character
for chastity: even those of the reformed religion were somewhat
scandalized by the levities of their ecclesiastical governess. Her
foreign biographer, Gregorio Leti, in his âHistoire dâElizabeth,â
says, âI do not know whether she was so chaste as is reported; for,
after all, she was a queen, she was beautiful, young, full of wit, delighted
in magnificent dress, loved entertainments, balls, pleasures,
and to have the handsomest men in her kingdom for her favourites.
This is all I can say of her to the reader.â</p>

<p class='c000'>The charge of personal depravity in so illustrious a sovereign deserves
a fuller examination than is admissible within our limits. But
it is in a great measure discredited by the circumstance that it
originated with those Romish and political enemies, who perseveringly
strove to destroy the queen, as the main prop of that fabric they were
moving every engine to overthrow. Dr. Sanders and Cardinal Allen,
the popes, the Spanish writers and their partisans, make statements,
some of them manifestly untrue, others unsupported by respectable
testimony. Among her own subjects, the popular scandal turned
chiefly on Leicester, Hatton, and Essex; but without a single criminating
fact as to either. Bacon states the case candidly, and probably
puts it on its true ground: âShe suffered herself to be honoured,
and caressed, and celebrated, and extolled with the name of love, and
wished it and continued it beyond the suitability of her age. If you
take these things more softly, they may not even be without some admiration,
because such things are commonly found in our fabulous
narratives, of a queen in the islands of Bliss, with her hall and
institutes, who receives the administration of love, but prohibits its
licentiousness. If you judge them more severely, still they have this
admirable circumstance, that the gratifications of this sort did not
much hurt her reputation, and not at all her majesty, nor even relaxed
her government, nor were any notable impediment to her state
affairs.â Some writers of secret history have assigned the danger
to which it was thought she would be exposed in bearing children as
the real reason for her perseverance in celibacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>We do not propose to relate the events of the reign of Elizabeth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>inasmuch as our object does not extend beyond a sketch of her personal
character. It is perhaps the most brilliant period in English
history; it called into action some of the most able statesmen and
greatest warriors of whom this country could ever boast. Leti tells
us that Pope Sixtus V. was her ardent admirer, and placed her
among the only three persons who, in his estimation, deserved to
reign: the other two members of this curious triumvirate were Henry
IV. of France and himself. He once said to an Englishman, âYour
queen is born fortunate: she governs her kingdom with great happiness;
she wants only to be married to me, to give the world a second
Alexander.â The same author, in his life of Sixtus, records a secret
correspondence of that pope with Elizabeth; among other particulars
of which he relates the following anecdote. Anthony Babington, a
gentleman of Derbyshire, with other English papists, had engaged in
a conspiracy against the queen. Their project was, after having
assassinated her, to deliver Mary of Scotland from prison, and to
place her on the throne. Babington and three of his accomplices
armed themselves against the possible failure of their enterprise, by
applying to the pope for prospective absolution, to take effect at the
time of their last agonies. His Holiness complied with their demand;
but is said instantly to have despatched due warning to the queen.</p>

<p class='c000'>This conspiracy was the preliminary to an event, which has been
justly characterized as the stain of deepest dye on the fair fame of
Elizabeth,âthe execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1586. It
would be foreign to the subject, to relate the circumstances which
led that princess to take refuge in England, trusting to Elizabethâs
promises of protection and kindness. Her reception at first was
as favourable as was perhaps consistent with due attention to the
public safety, considering that the Roman Catholic portion of British
subjects held her to be the rightful sovereign, and Elizabeth an
illegitimate and heretical usurper. But feelings of habitual enmity,
enforced perhaps by the arguments of her political advisers, overpowered
the sympathy of the first moments, and suggested the advantages
to be taken of a defenceless competitor. Elizabeth, therefore,
after having in the first instance ordered her to be treated like a
queen, afterwards committed her to close prison. On the discovery
of Babingtonâs plot, in which Mary was deeply implicated, the queen
of Scots was arraigned of high treason before commissioners specially
appointed by the crown. By that solemn tribunal, she was
tried and found guilty, and by Elizabeth was delivered over to execution.
Even Bohun, in his character of Elizabeth, though in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>general her panegyrist, says on this occasion, âBy this action, she
tainted her reign with the innocent blood of a princess, whom she had
received into her dominions, and to whom she had given sanctuary.â
If the sentence was executed, not in vindication of the offended laws,
but as a sacrifice to personal revenge, Elizabethâs guilt was greatly
aggravated by her extreme dissimulation in the management of the
affair. She no sooner received intelligence of Maryâs decapitation,
than she abandoned herself to misery and almost despair: she put on
deep mourning; her council were severely rebuked; her ministers, and
even Burleigh, were driven from her presence with furious reproaches.
Her secretary Davison was subjected to a process in the Star-Chamber
for a twofold contempt, in having revealed her Majestyâs counsels
to others of her ministers, and having given up to them the warrant
which she had committed to him in special trust and secrecy, to be
reserved for a case of sudden emergency. But Davisonâs apology, an
extract from which was inserted by Camden in his Annals, has since
been found entire among the original papers of Sir Amias Paulet.
From this authentic source it appears, that Davison was made her
unconscious agent and instrument. Those who have endeavoured to extenuate
the apparent treachery of Elizabeth, have alleged that the queen
of Scots kept the queen of England in continual dread of dethronement;
and that if the necessity existed to take the life of the queen
of Scots, it was equally necessary that it should be done with a show
of reluctance, and the least possible odium to the queen of England.
Such has been the defence, both of the act itself, and of the subsequent
dissimulation. But it would be difficult to apologize for her
proceedings against Davison, an able and honest servant, whom she
disgraced and ruined, for the purpose of impressing the belief that
Mary was executed without her knowledge and contrary to her intentions.
Right and wrong must be differently estimated in sovereigns
and ordinary persons, if the sacrifice of such a victim to the shade of
Mary or the indignation of her son can be justified.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reign of Elizabeth lasted forty-four years, four months, and six
days. It was distinguished by great actions; it raised the British name
to a high and glorious rank in the scale of nations: and we of the present
times are indebted to it for some of our greatest advantages. But
the sovereign herself closed her long and eventful life in a state of deep
melancholy. Her kinsman, Sir Robert Cary, relates, with the quaintness
of the time, the circumstances of his visit to her on her death-bed.
âShe took me by the hand, and wrung it hard, and said that
her heart had been sad and heavy for ten or twelve days; and in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>discourse she fetched not so few as forty or fifty great sighs. I was
grieved at first to see her in this plight; for in all my lifetime I never
knew her fetch a sigh, but when the Queen of Scots was beheaded.â
She died March 24, 1603, in her seventieth year. Few as are the
particulars of her life which we have been able to admit into our narrative,
they have perhaps been sufficient to give an outline, however
faint, of her character. It has been drawn out in form, and with fairness,
by Lord Bolingbroke, in the following passage from his Idea of
a Patriot King. âOur Elizabeth was queen in a limited monarchy,
and reigned over a people at all times more easily led than driven;
and at that time capable of being attached to their prince and their
country by a more generous principle than any of those which prevail
in our days, by affection. There was a strong prerogative then in
being, and the crown was in possession of greater legal power. Popularity
was however then, as it is now, and as it must always be in
mixed government, the sole foundation of that sufficient authority and
influence which other constitutions give the prince gratis and independently
of the people, but which a king of this nation must acquire.
The wise queen saw it; and she saw too how much popularity
depends on those appearances that depend on the decorum, the
decency, the grace, and the propriety of behaviour of which we are
speaking. A warm concern for the interest and honour of the nation,
a tenderness for her people and a confidence in their affections, were
appearances that ran through her whole public conduct, and gave life
and colour to it. She did great things; and she knew how to set
them off according to their true value, by her manner of doing them.
In her private behaviour she showed great affability, she descended
even to familiarity; but her familiarity was such as could not be imputed
to her weakness, and was therefore most justly ascribed to her
goodness. Though a woman, she hid all that was womanish about
her; and if a few equivocal marks of coquetry appeared on some
occasions, they passed like flashes of lightning, vanished as soon as
they were discovered, and imprinted no blot on her character. She
had private friendships, she had favourites: but she never suffered her
friends to forget that she was their queen; and when her favourites
did, she made them feel that she was so.â</p>

<p class='c000'>Our delineation of Elizabeth has been rather that of a very great
personage, than of a good woman; but it must be admitted on all
hands, that the poison of calumny has been largely administered, in
proportion to the invidiousness of her position. This general lot of
greatness fell the heavier on her, in consequence of the severe laws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>which she was compelled to enact and execute against the papists.
The libels against Elizabethâs good fame were put forth mostly
by persons of that proscribed sect, who have represented her, not as
indulging the frailties from which her most strenuous advocates cannot
exonerate her, but as a monster of cruelty, avarice, and lust. It
is but justice to place in contrast with so hateful a picture the
noble character ascribed to her even by a Jesuit, in a book published
in the Catholic metropolis of France. PÃ¨re dâOrleans, in his
âHistoire des Revolutions dâAngleterre,â speaks thus: âElizabeth
was a person whose name immediately imprints in our minds such
a noble idea, that it is impossible well to express it by any description
whatsoever. Never did a crowned head better understand the
art of government, and commit fewer errors in it, during a long reign.
The friends of Charles V. could reckon his faults: Elizabethâs enemies
have been reduced narrowly to search after hers; and they,
whose greatest concern it was to cast an odium upon her conduct,
have admired her. So that in her was fulfilled this sentence of the
Gospel, that the children of this world are often wiser in their views
and designs than the children of light. Elizabethâs aim was to reign,
to govern, to be mistress, to keep her people in submission, neither
affecting to weaken her subjects, nor to make conquests in foreign
countries; but yet not suffering any person to encroach in the least
upon the sovereign power, which she knew perfectly well how to
maintain, both by policy and by force. For no person in her time had
more wit, more skill, more judgment than she had. She was not a
warlike princess; but she knew so well how to train up warriors, that
England had not for a long time seen a greater number of them, nor
more experienced.â</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
